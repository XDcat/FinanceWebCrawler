<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus </h4>
<p><span>We study the relationship between international bond portfolio flows and exchange rate returns across a range of emerging market economies (EMEs). In particular, we investigate whether international bond flows are correlated with subsequent exchange rate changes, and if such a relationship could be exploited as a portfolio strategy.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution </h4>
<p><span>We contribute to the literature on the predictability of exchange rate returns by studying a novel leading indicator: international portfolio flows to funds investing in bonds. Our focus is on EMEs, which helps shine a light on the importance of portfolio flows for exchange rate fluctuations in such economies. As a result, we identify a new flow-based risk factor that is priced in the cross section of EME currencies.</span></p>
<h4>Findings </h4>
<p><span>Using a portfolio approach, we find evidence of a positive relationship between bond flows and future exchange rate returns of EMEs, which is not present for advanced economy currencies. EME currencies tend to depreciate following large bond outflows, while they tend to appreciate following inflows. A dollar-neutral portfolio that goes long in inflow currencies and shorts outflow currencies earns large excess returns that are not correlated with ones from known international portfolio strategies. This reflects the existence of a flow-based risk factor that is priced in EME currencies. It is consistent with investors requiring compensation for the risk that countries experiencing large portfolio inflows today could be facing a future tightening of their aggregate financial conditions.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the relationship between international bond ows and exchange rate returns for a panel of emerging market economies (EMEs). Specifically, we investigate whether international net bond ows are correlated with subsequent changes in the value of the local currency against the US dollar. Using a portfolio approach, we find evidence of a positive relationship between bond ows and future exchange rate returns of EMEs, which is not present for advanced economy currencies. EME currencies tend to depreciate following large bond out ows, while they tend to appreciate following in ows. A dollar-neutral portfolio that goes long in in ow currencies and shorts out ow currencies earns large excess returns that are not correlated with ones from known international portfolio strategies. Moreover, using an asset pricing approach, we find strong evidence that a risk factor implied by this result is priced in the cross-section of currencies. These findings are consistent with investors requiring compensation for the risk that countries experiencing large portfolio in ows today could be facing a future tightening of their aggregate financial conditions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Which are the key determinants of oil prices, and what role do financial factors play in Brent price formation? This paper sheds a new light on these fundamental questions relying on a widely used machine learning technique (random forests, based on 1,000 regression trees). As the article shows, the use of this technique leads to very large gains in oil price forecasting performance.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Besides strong forecasting performance, this powerful data-driven method also uncovers how economic and financial variables relate to oil prices. The benchmark model relies on 11 explanatory variables, which are firmly grounded on economic theory and measured on a daily frequency. The analysis reveals that financial factors play a very significant role in Brent oil price formation, underscoring that oil prices are ultimately an asset price.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The analysis attests the strong performance of the random forest model in predicting oil prices. This is likely due to its ability to capture non-linearities, as well as complex interactions between explanatory variables. The out-of-sample root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the random forest model are between 51% and 68% lower than those of standard OLS models that use exactly the same set of explanatory variables. US interest rates, the value of the US dollar and the CBOE VIX market volatility index together account for 39% of the models' RMSE reduction, highlighting the importance of incorporating financial variables in an oil pricing model. The clear inverse relation between Brent price and the value of the US dollar is also made evident.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This study analyses oil price movements through the lens of an agnostic random forest model, which is based on 1,000 regression trees. It shows that this highly disciplined, yet flexible computational model reduces in-sample root mean square errors (RMSEs) by 65% relative to a standard linear least square model that uses the same set of 11 explanatory factors. In forecasting exercises the RMSE reduction ranges between 51% and 68%, highlighting the relevance of non-linearities in oil markets. The results underscore the importance of incorporating financial factors into oil models: US interest rates, the dollar and the VIX together account for 39% of the models' RMSE reduction in the post-2010 sample, rising to 48% in the post-2020 sample. If Covid-19 is also considered as a risk factor, these shares become even larger.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Cyber attacks are becoming ever more frequent and sophisticated, and firms and policymakers list cyber risk as a major concern. Financial institutions and financial market infrastructures are especially at risk, and the financial industry ranks consistently as one of the most-attacked industries. While there have been several studies and surveys on cyber threats for the private sector – and firms in the financial sector in particular – little is known about central banks' assessment of cyber risk.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a survey conducted in 2021 among the members of the Global Cyber Resilience Group to provide an overview on cyber risk in the central bank community. The survey contains responses from 21 central banks from all regions of the world. It examines the following questions: What are central banks' main cyber concerns, and how do they see the threat landscape? What measures do they take to pre-empt or counter cyber attacks? And how do they assess the risks to and the readiness of the financial sector at large?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We uncover four main insights. First, central banks from advanced economies and emerging market economies assess the frequency and costs of different cyber attacks differently. Second, central banks actively discuss and develop policy responses to cyber attacks and have significantly increased their cyber security-related investments. Third, central banks deem the potential losses from a systemically relevant cyber attack in the financial sector to be large, especially if it targets a big tech providing critical cloud infrastructures. Only a few central banks fully agree that the financial sector is adequately prepared for cyber attacks, and over half of the respondents think that the sector's investment in cyber security has been inadequate over the past year. And fourth, central banks already cooperate widely on a range of topics related to cyber risk, for example in developing sound principles for cyber resilience, creating a specific coordination centre for knowledge-sharing and developing common projects to limit cyber threats.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The rising number of cyber attacks in the financial sector poses a threat to financial stability and makes cyber risk a key concern for policy makers. This paper presents the results of a survey among members of the Global Cyber Resilience Group on cyber risk and its challenges for central banks. The survey reveals that central banks have notably increased their cyber security-related investments since 2020, giving technical security control and resiliency priority. Central banks see phishing and social engineering as the most common methods of attack, and the potential losses from a systemically relevant cyber attack are deemed to be large, especially if the target is a big tech providing critical cloud infrastructures. Generally, respondents judge the preparedness of the financial sector for cyber attacks to be inadequate. While central banks in most emerging market economies provide a framework for the collection of information on cyber attacks on financial institutions, less than half of those in advanced economies do. Cooperation among public authorities, especially in the international context, could improve central banks' ability to respond to cyber attacks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We propose a strategy to build a "net zero" portfolio of sovereign securities that delivers progressively declining carbon footprints. Passive investors could use it as a new benchmark that is consistent with the Paris Climate Accords while keeping the portfolio's financial characteristics as close as possible to a business-as-usual benchmark.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our research is among the first to propose a decarbonisation strategy for sovereign securities portfolios. It is easy to implement and suitable for passive investors given the limited impact on the net zero portfolio's financial performance. However, it is a powerful tool to encourage sovereign governments to keep up their commitments in the Paris Climate Accords because of potentially large weight shifts for sovereign issuers after portfolio rebalancing relative to the business-as-usual benchmark.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our strategy rewards sovereign issuers that have made stronger efforts to reduce the carbon intensity of economic activity in their jurisdiction, measured by total domestic emissions per capita. The net zero portfolio we propose could reduce carbon intensity by 41% between 2014 and 2019 without affecting the portfolio's financial performance. The reduction in carbon intensity is achieved by assigning higher weights to countries with lower carbon emissions. Among advanced economies, portfolio rebalancing increases the shares of France, Italy and Spain while reducing that of the United States. Among emerging market economies, the weights of Chile, the Philippines and Romania would increase at the expense of China. Even when changes in country weights in the net zero portfolio are capped, the portfolio can still achieve a 30% cumulative reduction in carbon intensity, much higher than the business-as-usual benchmark could achieve (14%).</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We propose a strategy to build portfolios of sovereign securities with progressively declining carbon footprints. Passive investors could use it as a new Paris-consistent benchmark to construct a "net zero" (NZ) portfolio while tracking closely the risk-adjusted returns of a business-as-usual (BAU) benchmark. Our strategy rewards sovereign issuers that have made stronger efforts in reducing carbon intensity, measured by total domestic emissions per capita. The NZ portfolio would have reduced carbon intensity by 41% between 2014 and 2019, by assigning higher weights to countries that have had lower carbon emissions. Among advanced economies, rebalancing leads to raising shares of France, Italy and Spain in the portfolio at the expense of the United States. And among emerging market economies, this leads to higher shares for Chile, the Philippines and Romania at the expense of China. Importantly, the NZ portfolio retains the same creditworthiness as the BAU benchmark without entailing materially higher foreign exchange risks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Large technology firms ("big techs") have access to massive amounts of data about firms that operate on their online platforms or use their QR-code payment systems. While this information can be harnessed to improve the assessment of a firm's credit risk, it may also lead to "data dominance", when the big tech can extract rents from the firm and reduce its profits to the minimum. In the case of e-commerce platforms, data dominance is compounded by the fact that firms are somewhat captive in the big tech ecosystem. In fact, defaulting on a big tech loan could cause a firm not only to be excluded from future loans (as in the traditional case of bank lending) but also to be shut out from the e-commerce platform and its payment services.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper studies the lending business model of big techs, comparing it with the traditional bank intermediation process based on collecting deposits at cheaper rates but making do with more limited information on clients. In particular, we develop a theoretical model to study an economy in which big techs compete with traditional banks by lending to firms that operate on their platforms. We focus on two advantages that big techs have with respect to banks: better information on their clients and better enforcement of credit repayment, since big techs can exclude a defaulting firm from their ecosystem. For their part, banks have more varied and cheaper forms of funding.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that, when banks and big techs compete for borrowers, this can lead to greater privacy for borrowers as big techs have an incentive to temper their drive to collect information about firm characteristics. In other words, to win the loyalty of client firms, big techs must exercise restraint on their capacity to extract rents. At the same time, greater privacy has a cost. If big techs limit their capacity to recognise a firm's type, this may increase the number of costly defaults and reduce investment in profitable opportunities. One way to mitigate these inefficiencies is for big techs and banks to focus on their comparative advantages: big techs can share processed information (rather than simply the raw data) with banks, while the latter can finance the loans using their cheaper and more ample sources of funding.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study an economy in which large technology companies, big techs, provide credit to firms operating on their platforms. We focus on two advantages that big techs have with respect to banks: better information on their clients and better enforcement of credit repayment since big techs can exclude a defaulting firm from their ecosystem. While big techs have both superior enforcement and complete and private information of the firm type big techs can encroach on banks' turf only if they guarantee some privacy to firms by tempering their drive to collect information about firm characteristics and leaving some rents to them. The way big techs share information i.e. by providing information publicly or in a private way entails different outcomes in terms of efficiency.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Business turnover, the process by which entrepreneurs create new firms and dissolve old ones, is a key feature of modern economies. Structural factors, such as barriers to entry or an inefficient insolvency process, play a considerable role in either slowing down or speeding up the entry and exit of firms.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In addition to structural factors, cyclical developments also matter. History would suggest that more firms are created in upturns and more liquidated in downturns. Yet the recent Covid-19 recession is somewhat at odds with this simple view. While most countries suffered a deep economic contraction, firm entry followed very different patterns across countries. In Europe for instance, Spain experienced a sudden stop in new firm creation while France had a boom, even if output fell by comparable amounts in both countries.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>This paper argues that growth expectations are the key driver for firm entry. Based on a sample of euro area countries, it shows that more firms are created in response to past exits when the economy is expected to grow faster. Similarly, a drop in past entry weighs less on subsequent entry when the economy is expected to expand quickly. In addition, it finds that the economic outlook affects firm entry mainly through expectations of public and private investment. This suggests that policies focused on increasing private and public investment can often help to strengthen the economy's supply side, by increasing firm entry and business dynamism.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>How do aggregate conditions affect the dynamics of firm entry? Do recessions force more firms out, allowing for more firms to enter subsequently? Or does this process require other circumstances to thrive? I look into these questions using sectoral data on firm entry and exit for the main economies of the Euro Area over 2009-2019. My main finding is that expected, rather than current, GDP growth shapes the dynamics of firm entry. Specifically, I find that entry increases with past exits at the sector-level, but only when aggregate GDP growth is forecasted to be strong. Also, with strong growth forecasts, past entry developments weight less on the subsequent sectoral entry dynamics. Periods of low entry and high exit, can therefore be followed by strong entry subsequently, when the economy is expected to grow strongly. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several controls. This includes the quality of insolvency proceedings, firms' ability to obtain credit or the presence of barriers to entry. Finally, I show that expectations of private and public investment drive the impact of growth expectations on the dynamics of firm entry.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p class="FirstParagraph">When monitoring capital flows and analysing international interconnectedness, it is useful to distinguish financial centres that specialise in cross-border financial activity from other countries. Such centres are a channel for international investment, as opposed to an ultimate source or final destination for funds. Also, their external assets and liabilities are exceptionally large compared with their domestic economy. As a result, they account for a small share of the global economy but a large share of international financial activity. We propose a quantitative, transparent and replicable method for identifying cross-border financial centres.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p class="FirstParagraph">Our method improves on previous classifications of financial centres, first, by focusing on the entrepôt nature of activity in cross-border financial centres. Second, we adjust for the high degree of dispersion in external positions when setting the threshold to distinguish between cross-border centres and other countries. Finally, we pool many years of data to capture longer-term trends in countries' financial activity.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the group of countries identified as cross-border financial centres varies over time and with different measures of financial intermediation. In 2020, we identify a core set of seven countries as cross-border centres: the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, Luxembourg and the Marshall Islands. Another five countries were included in this set at one point or another over the 1995–2020 period: The Bahamas, Curaçao, Gibraltar, Liberia and Mauritius. A somewhat different set of countries is identified when the focus is narrowed to intermediation through the interbank channel.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Financial centres that cater predominantly to non-residents – which we refer to as cross-border financial centres (XFCs) –are important intermediaries of cross-border financial flows. For analysing capital flows and international interconnectedness, it can be useful to distinguish countries that are home to XFCs from other countries. We improve on previous methodologies for identifying such centres by constructing a measure focussed on the intermediation activity inherent to XFCs and explicitly taking into account the non-normal distribution of this measure across countries when detecting outliers. We also minimise volatility in the set of countries identified as XFCs over time by de-trending the data and pooling years. Our methodology identifies a core set of 12 countries as XFCs over the 1995-2020 period, but the countries vary with time and different measures of activity.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>We study how unconventional monetary policy affects sovereign debt dynamics in a debt sustainability analysis (DSA). We estimate the impact of the ECB's pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) - and its unwinding - on sovereign spreads and how this affects debt trajectories. We also look at the effect of inflation under different central bank responses. </span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We incorporate conventional and unconventional monetary policy into a stochastic DSA. The model optimises debt financing, trading off financing cost and refinancing risk. Sovereign spreads depend on the debt level, which pushes up credit risk premia. The PEPP withdraws debt from the market; we calibrate the spread suppression as a function of the asset purchases. The model also evaluates the effects of the central bank balance sheet reduction once the debt matures (passive quantitative tightening (QT)). </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the PEPP substantially improves debt dynamics and that the effects last well beyond the end of the programme. Without PEPP, the debt level would probably be unsustainable. With PEPP, public debt is generally sustainable and returns to below pre-pandemic levels by 2030. Passive QT puts upward pressure on spreads – more intensely the earlier the unwinding – but debt does not return to the pre-PEPP levels. The effect of an inflation surprise depends on the monetary policy reaction, but the impact on debt dynamics is small in the medium term. The model also shows the implications for debt management. PEPP makes it possible for maturities to be lengthened to reduce refinancing risks without increasing financing costs.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We incorporate monetary policy into a model of stochastic debt sustainability analysis and evaluate the impact of unconventional policies on sovereign debt dynamics. The model optimizes debt financing to trade off financing cost with refinancing risk. We show that the ECB pandemic emergency-purchase programme (PEPP) substantially improves debt sustainability for euro area sovereigns with a high debt stock. Without PEPP, debt would be on an increasing (unsustainable) trajectory with high probability, while, with asset purchases, it is sustainable and the debt ratio is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by about 2030. The improvement in debt dynamics extends beyond the PEPP and is larger for more gradual unwinding of the Central Bank balance sheet. Optimal financing under PEPP induces an extension of maturities reducing the risk without increasing costs. The analysis also shows that inflation surprises have relatively little impact on debt dynamics, with the direction and magnitude of the effect depending on the monetary policy response.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is heavily used in economics and by policymakers. In many cases, the two-sided, full sample version is applied to determine trends. But the one-sided filter that is estimated recursively also has important applications. Most notably, it is embedded in the Basel III framework for the countercyclical capital buffer. In this paper, we show that the trend of the one-sided HP filter has a very close correspondence with the trend of the Holt-Winters (HW) filter.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We draw on the literature to show that the trend of the one-sided HP filter can be approximated by the HW filter. This implies an elegant, moving average representation. And it makes the computation of trends so simple that it can be implemented by any spreadsheet user. We also provide results how to apply the HW filter in practice.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In addition to showing that the one-sided HP filter can be very closely approximated by the HW filter, we highlight three further results. First, we derive a mapping between the smoothing parameter of the HP filter (typically called lambda) and the key parameters of the HW filter. Second, we provide an exact formula for the weights of the HW filter. Third, we discuss different ways to set the initial values for the HW filter.</p>
<p>We illustrate our approach by generating credit-to-GDP gaps using the different filters. We find that the HW filter closely approximates trends generated by the one-sided HP filter, independent of the starting point chosen for the HW filter.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We show that the trend of the one-sided HP filter can be asymptotically approx-imated by the Holt-Winters (HW) filter. The later is an elegant, moving average representation and facilitates the computation of trends tremendously. We confirm the accuracy of this approximation empirically by comparing the one-sided HP filter with the HW filter for generating credit-to-GDP gaps. We find negligible differences, most of them concentrated at the beginning of the sample.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '18 July 2022', 'title': 'The Holt-Winters filter and the one-sided HP filter: A close correspondence', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work1033.htm', 'author': 'Rodrigo Alfaro, Mathias Drehmann', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work1033.pdf'}

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Emerging market economies (EMEs) commonly combine inflation targeting monetary policy regimes with macroprudential tools, capital flow management measures and FX intervention, to meet the challenges they face from swings in capital flows. These swings raise difficult trade-offs for monetary policy and require policymakers to resort to complementary policy tools to enhance macro-financial stability. We provide a characterisation of these trade-offs, distinguishing between times of stress and normal times when vulnerabilities build up, and assess how complementary policy tools can address them.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We set out a small open-economy model incorporating key features of EMEs' economic and financial structure: a high exchange rate pass-through to import prices, low pass-through to export prices and shallow domestic financial markets in the form of occasionally binding leverage constraints. As a consequence of the latter, large capital outflows induced by a sudden tightening in global financial conditions give rise to sudden stops. We analyse monetary policy trade-offs and derive the optimal conduct of monetary policy as well as of macroprudential policy, capital flow management policy and central bank bond market and foreign exchange (FX) intervention.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>During a sudden stop, the central bank faces an intratemporal trade-off as output declines while inflation rises. In normal times, there is an intertemporal trade-off as the risk of a future sudden stop forces the central bank to factor financial stability considerations into its policy conduct. Leaning against capital flows and domestic leverage is a key feature of optimal monetary policy aimed at medium-term macroeconomic stability. Macroprudential policy, capital flow management measures and FX intervention mitigate both intra- and intertemporal trade-offs. Bond market interventions can further alleviate constraints in a sudden stop. Fiscal policy also plays a key role. A higher level of public debt and a weaker fiscal policy imply greater leverage and hence greater tail risk for the economy. This worsens the intertemporal trade-off and induces a tighter monetary policy stance, with the aim of leaning against these effects.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Fluctuations in the risk sentiment of global portfolio investors can lead to shifts in portfolio holdings, even without changes in fundamentals or currency mismatches on the part of the borrower. Such shifts in risk sentiment can occur when the investor's risk constraint is relaxed or tightened in reaction to market events. The focus is on how exchange rate changes affect risk constraints and hence the investor portfolios of sovereign bonds issued in the local currencies of emerging market economies (EMEs).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a theory of a global investor who holds a diversified portfolio of EME bonds in different currencies, but who evaluates gains and losses in dollar terms and is subject to a risk constraint. Any broad-based EME currency appreciation increases the investor's risk capacity by relaxing the risk constraint and increasing the investor's economic capital. We empirically assess the link between risk capacity, portfolio choice and exchange rates based on a panel of EMEs using fund-level bond purchases, bond spreads and high-frequency exchange rate shocks. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The key prediction of the theory is that a broad-based weakening of the dollar leads to larger portfolio inflows (and a larger compression in spreads) in the local currency bond market of a particular EME than an equivalent percentage depreciation of the dollar against the EME's currency. Empirical evidence strongly supports the key predictions of our theory.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We lay out a model of risk capacity for global portfolio investors in which swings in exchange rates can affect their risk-taking capacity in a Value-at-Risk framework. Exchange rate fluctuations induce shifts in portfolio holdings of global investors, even in the absence of currency mismatches on the part of the borrowers. A currency appreciation for an emerging market borrower that is part of a broad-based appreciation of emerging market currencies leads to larger bond portfolio inflows than the equivalent appreciation in the absence of a broad-based appreciation. As such, the broad dollar index emerges as a global factor in bond portfolio flows. The empirical evidence strongly supports the predictions of the model.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Are conglomerate firms highly productive? Or do they suffer from internal quarrels and squander investment opportunities? An established observation in the trade literature is that conglomerate firms are more productive than single-product firms. By contrast, the finance literature has established that multi-segment firms trade at a discount to single-product firms, with a lower valuation ("Tobin's Q"), because funds are misallocated across their divisions through the internal capital market.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Reconciling these two conflicting views, we develop a novel theory of misallocation within firms due to managerial empire-building. We introduce an internal capital market into a two-factor model of multi-segment firms. The combination of these features lets us investigate the interplay between internal capital markets and international competition, thus opening up the black box of multi-product firms for a closer inspection.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, we find that informational frictions between headquarters and divisional managers can lead to the over-reporting of divisions' costs, resulting in an inefficient allocation of capital across a firm's divisions. This misallocation results in the conglomerate discount, ie a situation in which the market values a diversified firm at less than the sum of its parts. Second, our model shows that international trade reduces capital misallocation through competition. Tougher competition lowers the cost level at which firms and their divisions can survive in the market and reduces managers' scope for misreporting. By reducing capital misallocation within firms, this shrinks the conglomerate discount. We test our model's key predictions with data on US companies and find strong support. Our findings imply that more market competition can go a long way towards curbing division managers' empire-building behaviour, because it intensifies pressure on headquarters to allocate funds toward the most efficient projects.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper develops a novel theory of capital mis-allocation within firms that stems from managers' empire building and informational frictions within the organization. Introducing an internal capital market into a two-factor model of multi-segment firms, we show that competition imposes discipline on managers and reduces capital mis-allocation across divisions, thereby lowering the conglomerate discount. The theory can explain why exporters exhibit a lower conglomerate discount than non-exporters (a new fact we establish). We then exploit the China shock as an exogenous shock to competition to test the model's predictions with data on US companies. Results show that tougher competition significantly reduces managers' over-reporting of costs and improves the allocation of capital within firms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the effects of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchase programme on equity risk premia. Constructing a unique panel data set of the amount of individual stocks that the BOJ has indirectly purchased in the programme, we see significant cross-sectional and time series variations among individual stocks due to their different weights in ETFs and the BOJ's policy changes on its share of purchases across ETFs. Using these cross-sectional and time series variations, we study whether the ETF programme changed the risk premia of Japanese stocks based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We reveal the mechanism by which the ETF purchasing programme affects stock prices. In our paper, it is shown that the BOJ purchasing programme changes the risk perception of market participants by intervening in the market when the market is hit by adverse shocks. This result suggests what the policy implications might be when the BOJ exits its ETF purchase policy. To avoid any adverse effects on stock prices, the exit policy should be designed so that it does not change the correlation structure of stock returns.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our empirical analysis reveals, first, that BOJ's ETF purchases instantaneously support stock prices on the day of purchase. In other words, daily purchases have a "flow effect". Second, the instantaneous positive effects on stock prices, combined with the countercyclical nature of the BOJ's purchases, have persistently reduced the market beta for Japanese stocks. According to our back-of-the-envelope calculation, the BOJ's programme has resulted in an economically significant decline in risk premia.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the eﬀects of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchase program on equity risk premia. We ﬁrst construct a unique panel dataset for the amount of individual stock that the BOJ has indirectly purchased in the program. Then, utilizing the cross-sectional and time-series variations in purchases associated with the BOJ's policy changes, the empirical analysis reveals that: (i) the BOJ's ETF purchases instantaneously support stock prices on the days of purchases, and (ii) the instantaneous positive eﬀects on stock prices, combined with the countercyclical nature of the BOJ's purchases, have decreased the market beta and coskewness of Japanese stocks, thus leading to an economically signiﬁcant decline in risk premia.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The massive wave of fiscal stimulus unleashed by governments in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the inflationary consequences of current fiscal policies. Is higher inflation after the pandemic a fiscal phenomenon? Will the need to manage high public debt levels result in fiscal dominance over monetary policy, posing a risk to price stability?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To investigate the contribution of fiscal deficits to the recent increase in inflation, we estimate an open-economy Phillips curve augmented with the fiscal balance using data from 21 advanced economies over four decades. Apart from the econometric specification, what distinguishes our analysis from previous research is that we carefully consider the fiscal-monetary policy regimes in place. Furthermore, we examine the effects of higher deficits not only on average inflation but also on the "tail risks" to future inflation outcomes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the strength of the deficit-inflation link crucially depends on what kind of fiscal-monetary policy regime is in place. A higher deficit is least inflationary under "monetary dominance", defined as the regime in which the fiscal authority acts prudently to stabilise public debt and the central bank is highly independent (and faces strong legal limitations on its ability to lend to the public sector). By contrast, the greatest inflationary effect is found under "fiscal dominance", defined as a regime in which fiscal policy is profligate and the central bank is constrained only in a limited way from lending to the public sector. Higher deficits increase the inflation risks on the upside (ie the probability of high inflationary outcomes), and these effects are larger in the fiscal dominance regime. Finally, given the size of the fiscal stimulus and other macroeconomic variables observed in 2020, forecasts from our model suggest that the high inflation of 2021 and 2022 appears more consistent with a regime of fiscal rather than monetary dominance.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using data from a panel of advanced economies over four decades, we show that the inflationary effect of fiscal deficits crucially depends on the prevailing fiscal-monetary policy regime. Under fiscal dominance, defined as a regime in which the government does not adjust the primary balance to stabilise debt and the central bank is less independent or puts less emphasis on price stability, the average effect on inflation of higher deficits is found to be up to five times larger than under monetary dominance. Under fiscal dominance, higher deficits also increase the dispersion of possible future inflationary outcomes, especially the probability of high inflation. Based on forecasts from our model, the high inflation experienced by many countries during the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic appears more consistent with a regime of fiscal dominance than monetary dominance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Contract terms are rarely disclosed in repo markets, except for repo financed by US Treasury securities. As a result, we still know relatively little about the market-wide relationships between haircuts, collateral and counterparty characteristics. This is especially true of the European repo market, where there is a shortage of high-quality collateral since government bonds are of heterogeneous quality. Our paper fills this gap in the literature by estimating these relationships using a transaction-level UK data set and, importantly, by showing what types of market friction (eg adverse selection) are relevant for repo haircuts in general.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We focus on the factors that drive repo haircuts using a unique trade-level repo database. To our knowledge, this is the only database that covers transaction-level haircut information for collateral with a wide range of qualities and a rich set of counterparties. The dataset also allows us to gain a market-wide view of how UK banks use bilateral repo contracts to intermediate liquidity and to study how the supply of this liquidity is affected by collateral quality, counterparty characteristics, bilateral relationships and contract terms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, we find that only 60% of collateral used in the UK market can be categorised as high-quality cash-like securities. This is in contrast to the US repo market, where high-quality securities such as US Treasuries are predominately used as collateral. Second, we find that banks obtain liquidity from asset managers, while providing liquidity to hedge funds. We also show that central counterparty (CCP) trades are significantly different from non-CCP ones. Third, we find evidence for collateral rehypothecation – on average, about 30% of collaterals are rehypothecated. Fourth, we find that more than a third of bilateral contracts have zero haircut. We also show that counterparties matter in haircut determination. Hedge funds are charged significantly higher haircuts, whereas larger borrowers with higher ratings receive lower haircuts. We also find that borrower-lender relationships affect haircuts significantly.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using a unique transaction-level data, we document that only 60% of bilateral repos held by UK banks are backed by high-quality collateral. Banks intermediate repo liquidity among different counterparties and use central counterparties to reallocate high-quality collateral among themselves. Furthermore, maturity, collateral rating and asset liquidity have important effects on repo liquidity via haircuts. Counterparty types also matter: non-hedge funds, large borrowers, and borrowers with repeated bilateral relationships receive lower (or zero) haircuts. The evidence supports an adverse selection explanation of haircuts, but does not find significant roles for mechanisms related to lenders' liquidity position or default probabilities.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Under inflation targeting regime, the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on public understanding of central banks' decisions, since expectations are a key channel of the transmission mechanism from policy actions to the economy. Here, private sector analysts play an important role and they shape their expectations in response to central bank announcements and data releases. Thus, it is important to study how private analysts' expectations react to new data and monetary policy decisions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study the effects of Mexico's Central Bank monetary policy decisions on the expectations about inflation and monetary policy rate of private forecasters. We used a novel survey with economic variables expectations such as inflation and the policy rate from economic analysts and we estimate a fixed effect model at analyst level using a panel. We study the differences in expectations before and after a monetary policy announcement.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that professional forecasters <span>''</span>listen'' to the central bank. In other words, the changes in their short-run expectations are different when there are monetary policy announcements. Inflation surprises affect short-term inflation expectations but do not affect long-term inflation expectations suggesting anchored inflation expectations. Additionally, monetary policy surprises have an impact on end-of-the-year inflation expectations and reference rate expectations.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper we study the effects of Mexico's Central Bank monetary policy decisions on the expectations about inflation and monetary policy rate expectations of private forecasters. We estimate a fixed effect model at analyst level using a panel of professional forecasters from 2010 to 2017. We study the differences in expectations before and after a monetary policy announcement and we compare them when there are no announcements. We find that professional forecasters "listen" to the central bank, i.e. the changes in their short-run expectations are different when there are monetary policy announcements. Also, we find that analysts' surprises in realized inflation affect short-term inflation expectations but do not affect long-term inflation expectations suggesting anchored inflation expectations. Aditionally, monetary policy surprises have an impact on end-of-the-year inflation expectations and reference rate expectations.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>All modern central banks have moved to a strategy that includes better communication tools, more transparency and accountability. Associated with this trend, in the last few decades the literature has substantially increased. The recent development of intensive computational tools that can transform text into data, provides additional ways to analyse and corroborate the benefits of greater communication and central banks' sentiment. Textual analysis has become itself a source of information and feedback for central banks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to turn the text that private banks send to their clients about the Mexican economy into vectors of topics. Then, we use NLP to determine the issues that the economic analysts discuss the day before and the day after of the Monetary Policy Announcement (MPA), and also the day before and the day after of the Monetary Policy Minutes in Mexico.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that every time, private banks cover a large diversity of topics and words before the MPA with no evident consensus of topics, and that almost always the quantities of terms and topics are reduced and repeated by almost every bank after the MPA indicating some surprise, and that the topics vary depending on the date of the MPA. We also found weak evidence that a measure of the size of the changes in the private bank's communication with their clients is positively correlated to changes in the long-term yields but negatively correlated to the size of exchange rate movements.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We determine if the communication of private banks to their clients with financial interests in Mexico changes or not after Mexico's Central Bank communicates its monetary policy decision (MPD) and also two weeks later, with the publication of the minutes of Mexico's Central Bank monetary policy decision (MMPD) between 2011 and 2019. We use unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to turn the text that private banks send to their clients about the Mexican economy into vectors of topics. We find that every time, private banks cover a large diversity of topics and words before the MMPD with no evident consensus of topics, and that almost always the quantities of terms and topics are reduced and repeated by almost every bank after the MMPD indicating some surprise (notable exception: the liftoff in December 2015), and that the topics vary depending on the date of the MMPD. The fact that private banks discuss the same topics and write to their clients with sentences that contain the exact same words indicates that the private banks react to the MMPD, independent of their opinion about the Central Bank's statements. We also found weak evidence that a measure of the size of the changes in the private bank's communication with their clients is positively correlated to changes in the long-term yields but negatively correlated to the size of exchange rate movements.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Forward guidance is a central bank statement that provides direct information about the probable state of monetary policy in the future. Its purpose is to influence interest rate expectations. But how exactly does it do so? This is not yet fully understood.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To study this issue, I construct central bank data that includes forward guidance and its attributes, central bank projections, and quantitative easing, which I then combine with survey data.  I describe how, when, and where forward guidance works and provide the first empirical evidence of the effects of forward guidance when a central bank makes a commitment.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>I find that forecasters revise their interest rate forecasts in the intended direction by five basis points on average following a change in forward guidance. I provide country estimates for The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Sveriges Riksbank, and Norges Bank. I also provide preliminary evidence that commitment-based forward guidance is exceedingly rare, but can strongly amplify forward guidance. Finally, I provide estimates of the extent to which this effect may be attributable to central bank information effects.</p>

<p><em>This paper was produced as part of the <a href="/events/ccaresearchconf2021/overview.htm">Final Conference of the BIS-CCA Research Network on "Monetary policy frameworks and communication (2019-2022)"</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central banks around the world distribute press releases detailing their monetary policy decisions. Central banks also include in those publications rationalizations for the policy choices and information about the central bank's economic projections. These documents may help guide the evolution of the policy rates by examining the discussions about future economic conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We examine the central bank press releases of inflation-targeting countries with a relatively long set of document releases. We conduct Latent Dirichlet Allocation to build custom dictionaries for each country, which allows us to account for the way central banks use certain terms and descriptions for their policy decisions and projections. We use an algorithmic Sentiment Analysis with the custom dictionary to calculate sentiment indices. We examine how these sentiment scores help predict future policy rate movements and evaluate how these indices co-move over time. Lastly, we evaluate the average impact of the sentiment index of the Federal Reserve press releases on the projections of sentiment scores of future press releases of other central banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>For a significant majority of inflation-targeting countries, the sentiment indices help predict the monetary policy changes in the short and medium term. Central banks can use the sentiment index to further refine their monetary policy press releases and more effectively convey information about their policy expectations. Moreover, many of the sentiment indices we evaluated have strong co-movements, especially during turbulent economic episodes, such as the Great Financial Crisis. This reflects the similarity in what central banks focus on as they make decisions about optimal monetary policy.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Around the world, several countries have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. These institutions set their target interest rates in monetary policy meetings. These decisions are then circulated through press releases that explain the policy rationale. The information contained in the press releases includes current policies, economic outlook, and signals about likely future policies. In this paper, using linguistic methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and semi-automated content analysis, we examine the information contained in the monetary press releases of inflation targeting countries. In addition, we build a custom dictionary for analyzing monetary policy press releases. Using Semi-automated Content Analysis, we then develop a measure, which we refer to as the Sentiment Score index, that quantifies the policy tilt implied in the information provided in the press releases. We find that for a significant majority of the in flation targeting countries, the index provides additional information that helps predict monetary policy rate movements.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Communication is nowadays an essential instrument in the conduct of monetary policy. Consequently, central banks are interested in assessing their communications strategies in order to determine whether or not information is disseminated with clarity and in such a way that they contribute to the effectiveness of monetary policy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We analyze Banco de la Republica's (Colombian Central Bank) communication by studying the effect on interest rates at different terms (i.e. the yield curve) of the delivery of information to the public through two different outlets, the minutes of the monetary policy committee's meetings and inflation reports. We analyze both numeric and textual information (from 2011-Q2 to 2018-Q4) to determine whether or not there is a significant impact of Banco de la Republica's communication on the yield curve. The methodology also allows us to determine the specific types of information that explain such an impact.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find no evidence that numeric information, namely the inflation and output growth forecasts contained in the inflation reports, has an impact on market rates. Regarding narrative information, we find that: (i) for inflation reports, there is evidence that it has a significant effect on just some of the market rates, and (ii) for the minutes, there is a significant impact on all the market rates analyzed. We also find that topics such as "domestic demand and economic sectors" and "inflation: target and inflation expectations" are the most relevant ones in the case of the minutes.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We analyze the effect on the yield curve of Banco de la Republica's communication through two specific outlets, the minutes of the monetary policy meetings and the inflation reports during the period 2011-Q2 to 2018-Q4. We extract numeric information from the inflation reports' fan charts, and narrative information -using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a computational linguistics tool- from the text of both outlets. We use an event-study approach to analyze the impact on four specific maturities: one-year spot, three-year forward, five-year forward and five-year ahead five-year forward rates. We find no evidence that numeric information has any effect on market yields. Regarding narrative variables we find that (i) for the inflation report, there is a significant effect on just two yields (one-year spot and five-year forward), and (ii) for the minute, there is a significant effect on all yields. We believe that these results may be explained by the publication lag of the inflation report during the period of analysis.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>There is a widespread consensus that central bank communication influences the expectations of economic agents, and that increasing transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy. Central bank communication has moved beyond simply informing agents on the perceived current and future state of the economy to becoming a key instrument to anchor inflation expectations. Therefore, it is essential to assess whether the central bank is efficiently communicating the intended signals to market and economic agents.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use computational linguistic techniques to analyze the content and tone of the statements and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) of the Banco Central do Brasil. We construct sentiment indexes that measure the perception of the Copom on inflation, economic activity and uncertainty, based on dictionary methods applied to a hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) model combined with feature selection techniques. This assures that every topic in the tree contains meaningful words for proper analysis, favors interpretability, and provides relations between themes without intervention by the researcher. The resulting sentiment indexes are compared with actual data to assess whether the Copom documents reflect the state of the economy. The model also allows for evaluating the coherence between statements and minutes.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The Copom statements and minutes properly communicate the actual state of the economy, although the correlation between sentiment indexes and economic variables was affected by significant changes in Banco Central do Brasil's communication in July 2016. This event affected the correlation between the indexes and observables and their volatility, which can be partially attributed to changes in the average number of words dedicated to topics associated with a specific subject. Even though statements do not share the same information with all details present in minutes, they both deliver the same message.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Central bank communication is a key tool in managing inflation expectations. This paper proposes a hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) model combined with feature selection techniques to allow an endogenous selection of topic structures associated with documents published by Banco Central do Brasil's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom). These computational linguistic techniques allow building measures of the content and tone of Copom's minutes and statements. The effects of the tone are measured in different dimensions such as inflation, inflation expectations, economic activity, and economic uncertainty. Beyond the impact on the economy, the hLDA model is used to evaluate the coherence between the statements and the minutes of Copom's meetings.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Inflation-targeting frameworks has led the literature to focus on monetary policy rules with a short-term interest rate as the main instrument. However, this is not representative of monetary policy implementation around the world. According to IMF AREAER database, in 2019 only 21% of 192 countries use such an instrument. Also, most studies analyzing rules for interest rates assume rational expectations and a high degree of credibility. However, many low-income and emerging countries face limited credibility. This paper study on what extent the instrument choice depends on the limits to credibility.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The comparison uses a small and open economy model with price and wage rigidities. To capture limits to credibility, we assume that inflation expectations are not rational, they are determined by econometric models that use past data to forecast (adaptive learning). In particular, the role that exchange rate movements may influence medium- and long-term inflation. Three simple policy rules are compared: a Taylor rule for interest rate, monetary aggregate growth rate, and an exchange rate peg. The pros and cons of using each of them are analyzed when the economy faces a shock to external borrowing costs.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The benefits and costs of these alternatives depend largely on the credibility framework. With high credibility (rational expectations) there is a trade-off between the dynamics of activity and inflation when a Taylor rule and money growth are compared, while maintaining a peg is costly. With limited credibility (adaptive learning), if exchange-rate surprises persistently change inflation expectations, the potential benefits of money-based rules are more limited. Thus, reducing exchange-rate volatility may be desirable to limit the costs associated with un-anchored expectations</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We evaluate the dynamics of a small and open economy under simple rules for alternative monetary-policy instruments, in a model with imperfectly anchored expectations. The inflation-targeting consensus indicates that interest-rate rules are preferred, instead of using either a monetary aggregate or the exchange rate as the main instrument; with arguments usually presented under rational expectations and full credibility. In contrast, we assume agents use econometric models to form inflation expectations, capturing limited credibility. We compare the dynamics after a shock to external-borrowing costs (arguably one of the most important sources of fluctuations in emerging countries) under three policy rules: a Taylor-type rule for the interest rate, a constant-growth-rate rule for monetary aggregates, and a fixed exchange rate. The analysis identifies relevant trade-offs in choosing among alternative instruments, highlighting specially the role of exchange-rate volatility in shaping medium- and long-term inflation forecasts, and its consequences for policy design.</p>

<p><em>This paper was produced as part of the BIS Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA) research conference on <a href="https://www.bis.org/events/ccaconf2021/agenda.htm">The economics of the Covid-19 pandemic</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>What is the impact of unconventional credit policy in a zero lower bound environment? We study the effectiveness of unconventional credit policy once the economy reaches the zero lower bound and whether this policy can make it less likely that the economy will reach the zero lower bound.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>The zero lower bound in the monetary policy rate was an important constraint faced by several central banks during the Covid-19 global shock. However, monetary policy now includes unconventional measures, such as liquidity facilities or government-guaranteed corporate lending. In this context, our contribution is to uncover the implications and limitations of unconventional credit policy in a zero lower bound environment. The unconventional credit policy entails central bank liquidity injections into banks in exchange for their commitment to use these resources to make government-guaranteed loans. Our findings show the various ways that unconventional credit policies influence credit supply and demand frictions.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span>We find that unconventional credit policy can partially undo the effects of credit frictions and prevents the economy from reaching the zero lower bound. Since bank loans, funded with central bank liquidity, cannot be diverted by banks and are government-guaranteed, credit policy increases credit supply and credit demand. In addition, once the economy reaches the zero lower bound, the effect of unconventional credit policy is reduced because a constrained monetary policy to stabilise inflation exacerbates financial frictions and significantly reduces entrepreneurs' incentives to demand bank loans.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper we develop a simple two-period model that reconciles credit demand and supply frictions. In this stylized but realistic model credit and deposit markets are interlinked and credit demand and credit supply frictions amplify each other in such a way that produces in equilibrium inefficiently low levels of credit and stronger reductions of the real and nominal interest rates, so an economy is much closer to the ZLB. However, an unconventional credit policy, that consists on central bank liquidity injection to banks provided they commit to issue loans (indirect central bank loans) that are guaranteed by the government, can undo partially the effects of the credit frictions and prevents the economy from reaching the ZLB. Since indirect central bank (CB) loans cannot be diverted by banks and are governmentguaranteed, credit market interventions rise aggregate credit supply and positively affect the aggregate credit demand, respectively. However, once the economy is at the ZLB the effect of a credit policy is reduced due to a relatively stronger inflation reduction, which in turn reduces entrepreneurs' incentives to demand bank loans, and due to that the relative cost reduction from having access to cheaper indirect CB loans is smaller.</p>

<p><em>This paper was produced as part of the BIS Consultative Council for the Americas (CCA) research conference on <a href="https://www.bis.org/events/ccaconf2021/agenda.htm">The economics of the Covid-19 pandemic</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>We analyse the role played during a pandemic by two monetary policy tools: conventional interest rate policy and forward guidance. We ask two interrelated questions. First, given the environment brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, should we expect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to be the same as in normal times? Second, how should monetary policy be optimally conducted in this environment?</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>Our model departs from standard models used for monetary policy analysis by incorporating an epidemiological aspect. In our framework, economic decisions and virus dynamics are interlinked. In our baseline scenario, the spread of a virus leads to a ramp-up in both mandatory and voluntary social distancing measures and triggers a sizeable recession.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span>Our first main finding is that monetary policy is less effective in a pandemic than in normal times. In a pandemic, consumption is less sensitive to real interest rate changes as households factor the risk of becoming sick into their decisions. Our second main finding is that the optimal design of monetary policy hinges on how other tools used to limit virus spread, such as lockdowns, are deployed. If the lockdown policy is set optimally, monetary policy should focus on keeping inflation on target. However, if the lockdown policy is not optimal, the central bank faces a trade-off between its objective of stabilising inflation and the need to minimise the inefficiencies associated with virus spread. The trade-off is resolved by tightening monetary policy more the more sub-optimal the lockdown policy is.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We embed an extension of the canonical epidemiology model in a New Keynesian model and analyze the role of monetary policy as a virus spreads and triggers a sizable recession. In our framework, consumption is less sensitive to real interest changes in a pandemic than in normal times because individuals have to balance the benefits of taking advantage of intertemporal substitution opportunities with the risk of becoming sick. Accommodative monetary policies such as forward guidance result in large increases in inflation but have only limited effects on real economic activity as long as the risk of infection is large. The optimal design of monetary policy hinges on how other tools used to limit virus spread, such as lockdowns, are deployed. If the lockdown policy is conducted optimally, monetary policy should focus on keeping inflation on target. However, if the lockdown policy is not optimal, the central bank faces a trade-off between its objective of stabilizing inflation and the necessity to minimize the inefficiencies associated with virus spread.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Studying market power is important, as banks with greater market power tend to charge more from consumers. Although there are differences among a country's local credit markets, market power is typically assessed at the national level. The Covid-19 pandemic was an unexpected shock and affected regions differently. Has it changed banks' market power? Compared with more traditional banks, have more digitalised banks improved their positioning in terms of market power during the pandemic?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We investigate differences in effective prices, marginal costs, credit concessions, credit revenues, and total costs across bank branches. We use these results to determine whether the bank's market power in local credit markets has changed due to the pandemic. We also examine how digitalisation provided cost and lending flexibility, and how these features enabled banks to leverage their market power in local credit markets.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The pandemic had no impact on effective prices but increased the marginal cost of bank branches more affected by Covid-19. This led to a reduction in market power for banks in more affected locations. We also found that branches of more digitalised banks expanded credit beyond their physical locations and were able to adjust their total costs in the short term. As a result, they mitigated the market power loss caused by Covid-19.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates how COVID-19 and digitalization affected the market power in local Brazilian credit markets. We first propose a novel methodology to estimate bank market power at the local level. We design a data-intensive local version of the Lerner index by developing heuristics to allocate national-level banks' inputs, products, and costs across their branches using large-scale datasets from many sources. We then exploit the exogenous variation in COVID-19 intensity across Brazilian localities to analyze how the pandemic influenced local market power through the effective price and marginal cost channels. Despite reducing the economic activity, COVID-19 did not impact the effective price channel: bank branches offset the decrease in credit income by reducing credit concessions. However, bank branches more affected by COVID-19 experienced increased marginal costs as they could not rapidly adjust their cost factors in response to the decrease in credit concessions. Consequently, COVID-19 reduced banks' local market power via the marginal cost channel. More digitalized bank branches enjoy cost and lending flexibility: they experience less stickiness in their cost structure and complement the reduced credit concessions in localities more affected by COVID-19 by extending credit to borrowers in remote localities less affected. Consequently, more digitalized banks improve their market power compared to traditional banks. This paper provides new insights into how crises can affect local market power in non-trivial ways.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Under ideal circumstances, cross-border payments would be processed as seamlessly as comparable domestic payments, even where multiple currencies are involved. In practice, however, each border can add to the costs of a cross-border payment if crossing the border means entering a different technological, regulatory and legal environment, with different systems, regulators, and courts. This paper analyses regional payment integration projects across the world to identify key lessons for future cross-border payment enhancements on regional and global level, focusing on the role of technology, law and regulation. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Technological, legal and regulatory harmonisation across borders can reduce the barriers to effective cross-border payments. However, research on the integration of regional payments systems has so far been underdeveloped and the interactions of technology, law and regulation have not been explored in detail. We seek to address that gap and show how these dimensions can contribute to more efficient, safe and inclusive cross-border payments, regionally and globally.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that a high degree of cross-border harmonisation via rulebooks has been instrumental for successful regional integration projects. Potentially costly events such as rejects, returns, and revocations of payment orders can be reduced, sanction screening and financial compliance processes be made more efficient. Drawing on this insight, this paper suggests globally coordinated action to develop a comprehensive framework to guide and support regional payment integration which we call a "Single Rule Book." Finally, we explore its potential contents and the minimum requirements the "Single Rule Book" would impose. </p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In October 2020, the G20 endorsed a significant initiative to enhance cross-border payments. Faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more inclusive cross-border payment services will deliver widespread benefits for citizens and economies worldwide, supporting economic growth, international trade, global development, and financial inclusion. Enhancing cross-border payments requires more than mere adoption of technical standards. The best outcome involves aligned technological, regulatory, and legal frameworks. This paper analyzes such payment integration projects.</p>
<p>Each border adds to the costs of a cross-border payment if crossing the border means entering into a different technological, regulatory and legal environment, with different systems, regulators, and courts. Under ideal circumstances, cross-border payments will be processed as seamlessly as comparable domestic payments, even where various currencies are processed. While this highly ambitious target is unlikely to be achieved globally in the short to medium term, regionally, the gap between cross-border and domestic payments has already been narrowed. At the global level, mismatches between the inter-institutional framework on the back-end and the contractual relationship with clients on the front-end represent potential costs for the payment services provider and increase legal risk, prompting costly legal, due diligence manual adjustments in payments processes. A high degree of cross-border harmonization via rulebooks along the technological, regulatory, and legal dimensions has been instrumental for successful regional integration projects and has promoted straight-through-processing. Potentially costly events such as rejects, returns, and revocations of payment orders have been reduced, sanction screening and financial crime compliance processes agreed.</p>
<p>Drawing on this insight, this paper suggests globally coordinated action to develop a comprehensive framework to guide and support regional payment integration. This we call a "Single Rule Book." Such a Single Rule Book could be instrumental in enhancing safety, efficiency, and integrity in cross-border payments. We explore its potential contents, and importantly, the minimum standards it would impose.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Traditionally cross-border payments have relied on a mutually trusted central entity. Distributed ledgers, blockchain and smart contracts (together dubbed "distributed ledger technologies" or DLT) could provide an alternative to that approach. However, different DLT applications in the cross-border payments context come with legal challenges. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the extent to what financial law and regulation is fit to deal with DLT-based payments.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that conflicting laws and regulations in a cross-border context could create an impediment to smooth cross-border payment flows. However, research so far has focused on technical concepts and lacked legal details. In turn, there is a gap in legal research as to what in detail creates said barriers. Our research fills this gap. We outline several concepts for DLT-based payments and then go on to inquire to what extent financial law and regulation is fit to deal with DLT-based payments. This  analysis of the legal challenges can inform authorities when adapting their laws and regulations, and thus reduce legal risk for DLT-based cross-border payments.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that financial law traditionally assumes that functions are concentrated in a single entity. Hence, the distribution of functions in DLT comes with the need for additional agreements, ongoing coordination across, and governance arrangements among each participant. Further, in a cross-border context, multiple regulators and courts of various countries will be involved. All of these must decide whether for compliance with the law and regulations they look at DLT as a whole ('ledger perspective') or each individual DLT participant ('node perspective'). On that basis we analyse the extent to which the ledger or the node perspective should prevail, resulting in policy recommendations for regulators.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Financial law and regulation have, to date, assumed that regulated activities and functions are concentrated in a single legal entity responsible and accountable for operations and compliance. Even with regard to financial market infrastructure where the regulatory perspective acknowledges the need for interoperability of many entities as a system, each entity is subject to its own rules and regulations, and can thus meet its own compliance requirements independent of other system participants. The entity-focused regulatory paradigm is under pressure in the world of DLT-based payment arrangements where <em>some </em>ledgers, and thus the performance of the services as such, are distributed. DLT arrangements could provide an alternative to the traditional reliance on a mutually trusted central entity to transfer funds and enable the creation of new foundational infrastructures by distributing technical functions or linking existing systems. As such, we identify and outline concepts for use cases where DLT is potentially improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, namely a Best Execution DLT, a DLT application for a Network of Central Banks, a DLT as an AML/KYC utility, as well as DLT arrangements for an Identity Platform, a Small Payments Platform and, finally, an Interoperability Platform connecting multiple closed-loop and proprietary banking systems.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic prompted governments to launch large economic policy packages around the world. How effective these packages have been?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To make a preliminary assessment, we use firm-level data for a large set of countries. We look at how firms were affected, based on their business sectors. This is because one yardstick of success is whether policy actions have given more of a lift to sectors that were more vulnerable to the pandemic. Firms are more vulnerable to social distancing or lockdown measures if they operate in sectors that rely more on face-to-face interactions when producing goods or providing services. Economic policy support would aim to help these worst-hit industries to mitigate spillovers and dislocation costs and to ensure that these firms have enough liquidity to avoid unnecessary bankruptcies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The fiscal stimulus was robustly and positively associated with firm performance in pandemic-prone sectors. There is also some evidence that the monetary stimulus was associated with improved sales. Further, foreign exchange interventions were associated with an improved interest coverage ratio for the hardest-hit firms. Thus, this early assessment seems to suggest that policy interventions have bought time for the hardest-hit industries, by supporting sales and improving liquidity.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use firm-level data to provide some early evidence on the effectiveness of COVID-19 economic policy packages. Our empirical strategy relies on the varying degree of vulnerability to the pandemic across industries. We find a robust association of fiscal stimulus with changes in firm performance indicators (as measured by sales-to-assets ratio, profit margin, interest coverage ratio as well as probability of default) in pandemic-prone sectors. We also observe marginal effects of monetary policy on the sales-to-assets ratio and of foreign exchange intervention on the interest coverage ratio in the hardest-hit firms. These results broadly survive a battery of exercises to address endogeneity. Additionally, we show that firms with a better financial position are more likely to take advantage of the stimulus packages to withstand the pandemic shock. Overall, these provide preliminary evidence suggesting that policy interventions have bought time for the hardest-hit industries, by supporting turnover and improving liquidity.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p class="FirstParagraph">The market capitalisations of cryptocurrencies and related economic activities have grown phenomenally in recent years. While the role of retail investors has received much attention, we know less about the role of financial intermediaries in this sector. How significant is the presence of traditional intermediaries such as banks and investment funds in crypto markets, and what motivates them to take on cryptocurrency exposures? And how important are novel intermediaries such as crypto exchanges?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We gauge the significance of financial intermediaries in crypto markets, using a novel global supervisory database of banks' cryptocurrency exposures and a range of additional data sources. We assess the factors that determine banks' holdings of cryptocurrencies. In addition, we investigate the role played by novel crypto exchanges, and examine the cross-country drivers of institutionalisation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The potential for cryptocurrencies to scale up quickly calls for a comprehensive approach to assessing and mitigating risks, even though the interlinkages between crypto markets and mainstream finance have remained limited. The exposures of major banks to cryptocurrency exposures are currently still very modest, amounting to less than USD 200 million in 2020. We find that banks are more likely to hold cryptocurrencies when country indicators for greater innovation capacity, more advanced economic development, and financial inclusion are high. We also show that substantial activity is concentrated in lightly regulated crypto exchanges. This "shadow crypto financial system" serves both retail and institutional clients, such as dedicated investment funds.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The phenomenal growth of cryptocurrencies raises important questions about their footprint on the financial system. What role are traditional financial intermediaries playing in cryptocurrency markets and what drives their engagement? Are new nodes emerging? We help answer these questions by leveraging a novel global supervisory database of banks' cryptocurrency exposures and by synthesising a range of complementary data sources for other types of institutions. We find that major banks' exposures currently remain at very modest levels. Across countries, higher innovation capacity, more advanced economic development, and greater financial inclusion are associated with a higher likelihood of banks taking on cryptocurrency exposures. We show that substantial activity is concentrated in lightly regulated crypto exchanges. This "shadow crypto financial system" serves both retail and institutional clients, such as dedicated investment funds. An uneven regulatory treatment across banks and crypto exchanges and significant data gaps suggest that a proactive, holistic and forward-looking approach to regulating and overseeing cryptocurrency markets is needed. It should focus on ensuring a more level playing field with regard to financial services provided by established financial institutions and intermediaries in the emerging crypto shadow financial system by introducing more stringent regulatory and supervisory oversight for the latter.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The intertwined channels of fiscal and monetary policy are a challenge for policymakers. By design, the fiscal authority and the central bank decide and implement each form of policy independently. But taking policy decisions without considering the other side can lead to policies that are in conflict with one another. It is thus important to understand how fiscal and monetary policy interact and the nature of the feedback between them.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a model of the Mexican economy to analyse the response of fiscal and monetary policy to shocks and qualify their effects through estimation. In our model, authorities set their policy instruments according to rules tied to specific targets. The central bank targets inflation while the fiscal authority targets debt or the deficit. Fiscal and monetary decisions each influence the other's target through regular channels, such as economic slack and the exchange rate. But one key difference from other models is that we explore the sovereign risk premium channel. The risk premium transmits global shocks and affects domestic financial conditions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The sovereign risk premium plays an important role in how fiscal and monetary policy interact with each other. A rise in risk premium lowers output, raises inflation, depreciates the exchange rate and tightens domestic financial conditions. Monetary and fiscal policy can work together to offset these effects. The government scales back spending to reduce its borrowing requirements while the central bank raises the interest rate to curve currency depreciation and cap the growth in foreign debt. If both authorities respond forcefully enough, together they can reduce public debt and lower the risk premium.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We model the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy and qualify their effects in a semi-structural small open economy model calibrated for Mexico. In our model, fiscal and monetary policy follow rules tied to specific targets. We estimate how fiscal policy, through deficits and public debt accumulation, and monetary policy, through the interest rate, directly affect the economy. We study the nature of the feedback between policy decisions and examine their indirect effects through the sovereign risk channel. We find that the response of monetary policy to stabilise the economy after a shock depends on how strict is the fiscal rule. A loose fiscal stance pushes a tighter monetary policy stance. Instead, the economy recovers faster when monetary and fiscal policy complement each other.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Information asymmetries between small firms and credit intermediaries can reduce financing of good investment opportunities and keep promising entrepreneurial projects from being developed. To help solve this problem, small enterprises can post collateral, rely on credit history or build close and long-term relationships with specific lenders. Big data and machine learning, however, have provided a new solution, allowing large technology firms ("big techs") to use credit scoring techniques to provide lending to clients operating in their business platforms.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We look at the example of Ant Group, which started providing payment services through QR codes, allowing offline merchants to access digital payment services. Ant Group uses the information collected through these services to decide on credit provision to merchants. We explore whether: (i) the use of QR codes in payments gives firms access to big tech credit; (ii) access/use of big tech credit lets firms access more traditional bank credit; and (iii) the use of QR codes in payments and the subsequent provision of credit has real effects on firms' business volume.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We use a unique dataset of around half a million Chinese firms that use a QR code-based mobile payment system. We find that: (i) the creation of a digital payment footprint allows firms to access credit provided by the same big tech company; (ii) transaction data generated via QR codes generate spillover effects on access to bank credit; and (iii) there are positive effects of access to big tech credit on sales, including during the Covid-19 shock. Our findings suggest that access to innovative payment methods helps micro firms build up credit history, and that the use of big tech credit can ease access to bank credit.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Recent increases in inequality have prompted a lot of interest in what causes it. Existing research has identified international financial openness as one of the main potential drivers of income inequality. Nevertheless, the evidence has not been conclusive so far. This is largely due to the use of very different measures and methods across studies. Most papers have focused on legal restrictions on capital flows as a measure of openness ("de jure measures"). The few that have examined measures based on actual external financial positions ("de facto measures") have used only a subset of the key metrics.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We conduct a comprehensive empirical examination of the link between inequality and external financial openness for a sample of 48 countries between 1991 and 2013. In contrast to most existing studies, we focus on de facto rather than de jure measures of financial openness. Furthermore, we examine not only a key aggregate openness measure – gross external liabilities – but also its main components: foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio equity, portfolio debt and other investment.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that the relationship between financial openness and inequality varies considerably over time and across the main components of total external liabilities. In emerging market economies (EMEs), an increase in external liabilities is associated with an initial rise and a subsequent fall in inequality. This suggests that the inequality-increasing channels tend to be active immediately, while the channels working in the opposite direction tend to operate with a lag. While the overall pattern for FDI and portfolio debt is similar, there are notable quantitative differences. Meanwhile, an increase in "other investment" liabilities is associated with a lagged fall in inequality. In advanced economies, the link between financial openness and inequality is much weaker than in EMEs.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation of the link between inequality and financial openness. We document that the relationship varies considerably not only over time, but also across the main components of total external liabilities, which have been largely overlooked by the existing literature. In emerging market economies (EMEs), an increase in a country's external liabilities is associated with an initial rise and a subsequent fall in inequality. This appears to be driven by the fact that the channels through which financial openness increases inequality tend to be active immediately, while the inequality-decreasing channels tend to operate with a lag. The link between financial openness and inequality tends to be substantially weaker in advanced economies than in EMEs.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Forward guidance on the future path of policy rates has become a key element of central banks' monetary policy toolbox over the past decade. This paper analyses quantitative forward guidance through the publication of interest rate projections, a practice pursued by some inflation targeting central banks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Based on the experiences of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank, Sveriges Riksbank and the Federal Reserve, this paper looks at the effectiveness of quantitative forward guidance in terms of their (i) predictability, the extent to which markets are able to anticipate the central bank path; (ii) credibility, the ability of central banks to steer market interest rates through the quantitative guidance provided; (iii) redundancy, whether the central bank interest rate projections provide information beyond that provided through projections of key target variables (eg inflation or the output gap); and (iv) consistency, whether central bank interest rate projections are consistent with the published projections of policy target variables.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the interest rate projections released by these four central banks are predictable and credible but only in a limited way. Market expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates do anticipate changes in the central bank projection path to a significant degree, yet far from completely. At the same time, market interest rates adjust to path surprises. The adjustment is, however, far from one to one, and weakens as the projection horizon lengthens. We further find that interest rate projections are not redundant in terms of information content. Their impact on market expectations remains significant also when controlling for the effects of central bank macroeconomic projections. Finally, central bank interest rate projections are consistent with central bank macroeconomic projections. The projections are consistent with a widely used rule linking interest rates to inflation and the output gap.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We assess quantitative forward guidance through interest rate projections along four key dimensions: (i) predictability, (ii) credibility, (iii) redundancy and (iv) consistency. Based on data for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank, the <span>Sveriges</span> Riksbank and the Federal Reserve, we find that the interest rate projections released by these four central banks are predictable and credible, but in limited ways. Market expectations of the future path of interest rates predict changes in the central bank projection path, but far from fully. Central bank paths' credibility is limited as markets adjust to path surprises, but far from a one-to-one basis. Both predictability and credibility decrease with the projection horizon. We further find that central bank interest rate projections are not redundant as they impact market expectations also when controlling for the effects of central bank macro projections that are released in parallel. Finally, the interest rate projections are consistent with the macro projections as they are empirically linked by a stabilising Taylor rule.       </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores are becoming an increasingly important tool for asset managers to design and implement ESG investment strategies. However, there are drawbacks in using headline ESG scores that limit their usefulness. ESG scores amalgamate a broad range of fundamentally different factors, which creates ambiguity. Weak scores in one pillar can offset strong scores in another pillar.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We demonstrate an investment strategy based on deconstructing ESG scores. The strategy focuses on specific underlying ESG categories such as emissions reduction and human rights. To implement our investment strategy, we exclude firms with the lowest scores in certain ESG categories of interest and implement a best-in-class investment strategy.</p>
<p>This approach helps investors overcome the "aggregated confusion" inherent in ESG scores. Moreover, it enables investors to better track the sustainability performance trajectory of their portfolio against their stated sustainable investment objectives.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that simple exclusions enable substantial improvements to the headline ESG score of the portfolio. Here, the portfolio's financial performance only suffers a marginal impact relative to a broad stock market benchmark. However, the exclusion results in regional and sectoral biases compared to the benchmark.</p>
<p>To counter this, we adopt a best-in-class strategy that excludes firms with the lowest category scores and reinvests the proceeds in firms with the highest scores. This approach helps reduce the tracking error of the portfolio, and slightly improve its risk adjusted performance while still yielding a large gain in the headline ESG score.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores are becoming an increasingly important tool for asset managers to design and implement ESG investment strategies. They amalgamate a broad range of fundamentally different factors, creating ambiguity for investors as to the signals of higher or lower ESG scores. We explore the feasibility and performance of more targeted investment strategies based on specific categories by deconstructing ESG scores into their granular components. First, we investigate the characteristics of the various categories underlying ESG scores. Not all types of ESG categories lend themselves to more targeted strategies, which is related to both limits to ESG data disclosure and the fundamental challenge of translating qualitative characteristics into quantitative measures. Second, we consider an investment scheme based on the exclusion of firms with the lowest scores in each category of interest. In most cases, this targeted strategy still allows investors to substantially improve the portfolio headline ESG score, with only a marginal impact on financial performance relative to a broad stock market benchmark. The exclusion results in regional and sectoral biases relative to the benchmark, which may be undesirable for some investors. We then implement a "best-in-class" strategy, based on excluding firms with the lowest category scores and reinvesting the proceeds in firms with the highest scores maintaining the same regional and sectoral composition. This approach reduces the tracking error of the portfolio and slightly improves its risk-adjusted performance while still yielding a large gain in the headline ESG score.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Financial institutions and markets are highly interconnected. Accordingly, differences in national macroprudential policies can be an important source of international spillovers. Through cross-border regulatory arbitrage, these differences may lead to large swings in capital flows. In turn, the transmission of financial shocks across regions may be magnified – and financial risks exacerbated.  When global financial institutions can evade policy actions taken by regulators in their jurisdiction, financial cycles are not well synchronised across economies. Moreover, reverse spillovers are potentially significant.  However, prior coordination may improve global welfare. This is one of the rationales underlying Basel III's principle of reciprocity.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a two-region, core-periphery model with financial frictions. First, we characterise the cross-border leakages that occur when regulators in the core region tighten their macroprudential stance. Second, we evaluate the potential benefits of macroprudential policy agreements in the presence of regulatory arbitrage. Welfare gains associated with countercyclical capital buffers are calculated for three policy regimes: (i) independent national policies (Nash); (ii) international coordination; and (iii) reciprocity – The model is calibrated for two groups of countries: major advanced economies, and large middle-income countries which generate significant spillovers to advanced economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Numerical experiments show that our model replicates the stylised facts associated with monetary policy shocks. These relate to output, credit, house prices and real exchange rate fluctuations in recipient countries. We find that the magnitude of resulting cross-border capital flows depends on the degree of economies of scope in lending. Further, if regulators set policies on the basis of a narrow financial stability mandate – and these policies are evaluated in terms of household welfare – reciprocity may perform better than Nash and as well as international coordination. This is when regulatory leakages are strong.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A core-periphery model with financial frictions, imperfect financial integration, and cross-border banking is used to assess the magnitude of regulatory spillovers and the gains from international macroprudential policy coordination. A core global bank lends to its affiliates in the periphery and banks in both regions are subject to risk-sensitive capital regulation. Following an expansionary monetary policy in the core, a countercyclical response in capital requirements induces the global bank to engage in regulatory arbitrage. The magnitude of the resulting cross-border capital flows depends on the degree of economies of scope in lending. Welfare gains associated with countercyclical capital buffers are calculated for three policy regimes: independent policies (Nash), coordination, and reciprocity---a regime in which capital ratios set in the core are imposed on branches operating in the periphery. If regulators set policies on the basis of a narrow financial stability mandate, and these policies are evaluated in terms of household welfare, reciprocity may perform better than Nash, and as well as coordination for all parties, when regulatory leakages are strong.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a key role in the economy of the European Union. Yet, SMEs often find it more challenging to access finance than their larger peers. The gap between the demand for credit from financially viable SMEs and the actual credit supply, is known as the "SME financing gap". Among international financial institutions, the European Investment Bank (EIB) stands out in terms of annual lending volumes to SMEs. Previous research has shown that EIB-supported lending has a positive effect on the employment levels, size, investments and innovation capacities of SMEs. However, it remains unexplored whether these impacts vary based on different types of recipients, or by the parameters of the financial support – such as the cost of a loan, its maturity or volume.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We shed light on the transmission channels of public support schemes to the SME sector by investigating whether the positive impacts of EIB support vary depending on types of intermediaries and financial term sheets. In particular, we measure if there is a significant difference – in terms of job creation and investment dynamics – attributed to the EIB's support for smaller and younger firms. We further assess the extent to which the positive effects of EIB support can be attributed to longer loan maturities, more advantageous pricing and larger loan volumes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that in the years after receiving EIB support, smaller and younger firms exhibit stronger growth in employment and fixed assets than their bigger or older peers. Our results also show that the terms of EIB loan agreements play a pivotal role. The benefits of EIB support appear to be linked to longer loan maturities. Moreover, better pricing conditions are associated with a stronger effect on employment and fixed assets growth. We do not find evidence that the effects vary depending on loan size.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We estimate heterogeneous treatment effects of the EIB fnancial support on European firms between 2008 and 2015. The relevant control groups are created with propensity score matching and the effects are estimated in a difference-in-differences framework, controlling for firm-level and country-sector-year fixed effects. We find that the positive effects of EIB-supported lending on job creation and investments were larger for smaller and younger firms. Moreover, we find evidence that longer maturities and more advantageous loan pricing are associated with larger employment and investment effects, while no larger impact is observed for larger loan volumes. Overall, the results suggest that benefits of the EIB support are rather observed on an intensive, rather than on an extensive, margin.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p class="Paragraph">Reading the economic cycle is essential to implementing monetary policy. A key topic is whether employment is approaching its potential: the unemployment rate at which inflation remains constant in the absence of supply shocks (NAIRU). In Mexico and other Latin American countries, the sizeable number of informal workers makes it challenging to estimate the NAIRU. Since Mexico does not have unemployment insurance, workers who become unemployed immediately need to find a new job. The informal sector's flexibility allows it to absorb most of the people who cannot find a job in the formal labour market. As a result, the unemployment rate in Mexico is low and does not fully reflect labour market slack.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We estimate the NAIRU for Mexico. As standard measures may not depict labour slack accurately, we also estimate the NAIRU with an alternative measure of "unemployment" that includes unemployed workers and informal wage earners as an indicator of labour underutilisation. This methodology could be a useful tool for monetary policy analysis in emerging economies with significant informal labour.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p class="Paragraph">Our results suggest that the NAIRU and labour market slack follow similar patterns over time using either indicator of labour market underutilisation (the traditional one or the one which includes the informal sector). However, according to one model, the indicator that includes informal wage earners seems to predict inflationary pressures better when the unemployment gap is close to zero. Thus, it appears to anticipate the inflationary pressures observed in 2007–08 more clearly than the traditional slack indicator. In addition, both estimates show labour market slack decreasing throughout 2016 and approaching zero. The indicator that includes informality shows relatively more slack, consistent with the absence of significant wage pressures observed during this period.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is not directly observable, and the presence of informal workers imposes an additional challenge in its estimation. In this paper, we present an estimation of the traditional NAIRU for Mexico and an alternative measure that includes informality as an indicator of labor underutilization. We find that both measures of NAIRU and the associated labor market slack indicators follow similar patterns over time. However, the slack estimated with the indicator that includes informality seems to predict inflationary pressures more accurately when the unemployment gap is close to zero.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Having developed and deepened their local currency sovereign bond markets, many EMEs can now routinely borrow from abroad in their own currency. However, overcoming "original sin" – the traditional necessity of borrowing in dollars or another foreign currency – has not led to "redemption". As foreign investors still play an important role in their local currency bond market, EMEs remain vulnerable to capital flow and exchange rate swings. And this gives rise to "original sin redux".</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper provides a model-based evaluation of the original sin redux hypothesis based on a two-country model. We explore the channels through which original sin redux arises, the differences to the traditional original sin of borrowing in foreign currency from abroad, and the policy implications for EMEs.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The main findings are, first, borrowing from abroad in local currency falls short of eliminating the vulnerability of EMEs to foreign financial shocks, although it does reduce it. Second, additional macro-financial stability policy tools, such as FX intervention, can mitigate the challenges from capital flow swings in an original sin redux scenario. Third, in the longer run, a larger domestic investor base could reduce the vulnerability of EMEs to capital flow swings. Finally, local currency external borrowing and a larger domestic investor base strengthen the transmission of domestic monetary policy in EMEs, thus providing EME central banks with more policy traction.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Many emerging markets (EMs) have graduated from "original sin" and are able to borrow from abroad in their local currency. Using a two-country model, this paper shows that the shift from foreign currency to local currency external borrowing does not eliminate the vulnerability of EMs to foreign financial shocks but instead results in "original sin redux" (Carstens and Shin (2019)). Even under local currency borrowing from foreign lenders, a monetary tightening abroad is propagated to EM financial conditions through a tightening of foreign lenders' financial constraints. Moreover, local currency borrowing does not eliminate currency mismatches, but shifts them from the balance sheets of EM borrowers to the balance sheets of financially constrained global lenders, so that amplifying financial effects of exchange rate fluctuations remain. We provide empirical evidence in line with this prediction of the model using data on currency composition of external debt of emerging and advanced economies. Our model-based analysis further suggests that foreign exchange intervention and capital flow management measures can mitigate the adverse effects of capital flow swings in the short run and that a larger domestic investor base can reduce the vulnerability to such swings in the longer run.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How do the forces of globalisation make asset returns move together ("asset return co-movement")? Although real economic integration via trade linkages should play an important role in making international equity markets fluctuate together, it has proven challenging so far to demonstrate this empirically. We revisit the role of real integration as an economically significant driver of international asset return co-movement by drawing on insights from the literature on global value chains (GVC), overturning some of the previous findings in this literature.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>From a data set on GVCs, we construct a new data set of novel measures of intermediate and final trade intensity which according to our theoretical framework should matter for the co-movement of profits and hence stock prices. In comparison with more aggregate measures of trade interlinkages examined in prior work, our novel angle is to study real interconnectedness via these granular bilateral measures and to show how international trade matters for stock market dynamics in the presence of reciprocal production linkages.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>With our new measures, we provide evidence of a strong link between changes in real integration – in particular via GVCs – and equity market co-movement. This also holds when controlling for financial openness and other factors that could confound the role of real openness. First, we show that there are substantial differences between our novel measures of intermediate and final trade intensity and traditional openness measures, such as the ratio of exports and imports to GDP. Second, we find bilateral stock market co-movement to be related to trade integration measured by granular input-output linkages and value added of trade. Third, real integration explains equity market correlation well even when controlling for time trends, country characteristics, socioeconomic ties, and measures of financial integration.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Although real integration conceptually plays an important role for the comovement of international equity markets, documenting this link empirically has proven challenging. We construct a new dataset of theory-guided, relevant measures of bilateral trade in final and intermediate goods and services. With these measures, we provide evidence of a strong link between changes in real integration – in particular global value chains – and equity market comovement. This also holds when controlling for financial openness and other factors that could confound the role of real openness. These results suggest that supply chain disruptions, for instance due to political tensions and the COVID-19 crisis, might also affect the interconnections between stock markets via rippling through the global production network.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Massive issuance by BBB-rated firms has propelled growth of the US corporate bond market since the Great Financial Crisis. In this paper we investigate how quantitative easing (QE) boosted demand for BBB bonds and how it interacted with credit rating agencies' leniency to generate capital misallocation reminiscent of zombie lending.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Riskier firms typically borrow at higher interest rates compared with safer firms because investors require compensation for taking on more risk. However, this relationship has been turned on its head in the massive US BBB corporate bond market since the Great Financial Crisis. We show that prospective fallen angels – BBB-rated issuers vulnerable to being downgraded – paid 13 basis points less to borrow in the corporate bond market compared with safer BBB-rated peers. If these prospective fallen angels had been downgraded to the high-yield market, their funding costs would have risen by around $300 billion over the period from 2009 to 2019, according to our back of the envelope calculation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The prospective fallen angel subsidy can be attributed to an interaction between QE purchases and the leniency of credit rating agencies. Investors with portfolios most exposed to QE increased their demand for bonds issued by prospective fallen angels. This lowered the issuers' financing costs. Prospective fallen angels met this demand by issuing bonds, largely to finance mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), which served two purposes. Firstly, M&amp;A delayed credit rating downgrades. Secondly it helped the firms to grow their market shares. The bond market subsidy of prospective fallen angels adversely impacted competitors' employment, investment and sales. In addition, the early stages of the Covid-19 crisis exposed the vulnerability of prospective fallen angels. In just a few weeks at the beginning of 2020, vulnerable BBB-rated firms that engaged in M&amp;A were more likely to be downgraded, and by more notches.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We document capital misallocation in the U.S. investment-grade (IG) corporate bond market, driven by quantitative easing (QE). Prospective fallen angels – risky firms just above the IG rating cutoff – enjoyed subsidised bond financing since 2009, especially when the scale of QE purchases peaked and from IG-focused investors that held more securities purchased in QE programs. The benefiting firms used this privilege to fund risky acquisitions and increase market share, exploiting the reluctance of credit rating agencies to downgrade post-M&amp;A and adversely affecting competitors' employment and investment. Eventually, these firms suffered more severe downgrades at the onset of the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How do import prices affect inequality via their varying effects on the cost of living? When the Swiss National Bank removed the Swiss franc's exchange rate against the euro in January 2015, a unique opportunity arose to test methods of measuring welfare changes in response to changes in import prices. The episode was unique because the policy change resulted in a large and unexpected surge in the domestic currency's value when the macroeconomic environment was otherwise stable. Further, full microeconomic data on prices were available, as well as information on consumer spending and the currency of invoicing at the border.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The welfare effects of price changes for imported goods can very between different classes of consumers due to differences in their initial expenditure shares for imported goods and differences in how they replace imported with domestic goods or vice versa, ie "expenditure switching". The literature has thus far focused on the former channel, mostly owing to the difficulty of uncovering the underlying price elasticities between imported and domestic goods. Using data from Switzerland surrounding the 2015 appreciation of the Swiss franc, our contribution is to estimate the underlying parameters and to highlight the quantitative importance of these two channels.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that demand from lower-income households is substantially more price elastic than that of high-income households. This has significant implications for the distributional impact of changing import prices. We use two distinct quantitative approaches to estimate differences in the elasticity of substitution across incomes. In the first approach, we use the variation in changes in expenditure on imported relative to domestic goods, as recorded for higher- and lower-income households. In a second approach, we use the variation in expenditures across individual products and in product price changes. We also quantify the distributional welfare implications of counterfactual changes in import prices. For example, in response to a fall in import prices, low-income households would benefit more because they have higher price elasticities and, hence, will more readily replace domestic with imported goods. On the other hand, high-income households stand to benefit more because they have higher initial shares of imported goods.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>What are the unequal effects of changes in consumer prices on the cost of living? In the context of changes in import prices, most analyses focus on variation across households in initial expenditure shares on imported goods. However, the unequal welfare effects of non-marginal foreign price changes also depend on differences in how consumers substitute between imported and domestic goods, on which there is scant evidence. Using data from Switzerland surrounding the 2015 appreciation of the Swiss franc, we provide evidence that lower income households have higher price elasticities. These differences in elasticities contribute significantly to the unequal welfare effects of large import price changes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Operating through changes in market participants' risk capacity, the financial channel of exchange rates demonstrates how domestic financial conditions respond to exchange rate movements. We investigate whether stock market returns in emerging market economies (EMEs) reflect the financial channel of exchange rates. If so, we also consider if the broad dollar index has attributes of a cross-sectional asset pricing factor in EME stock markets, just as the broad dollar index serves as an indicator of the financial channel of exchange rate in other contexts.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The study makes three contributions in laying out the impact of the financial channel of exchange rates on stock market returns. First, we introduce "the dollar return multiplier" as the ratio of the dollar-denominated stock returns to the local currency stock returns and show that the dollar return multiplier is typically larger than one. Second, we show that the broad dollar index serves as a global factor in determining stock returns, with a stronger dollar being associated with lower stock returns. Third, we introduce the notion of the "dollar beta" as the sensitivity of stock returns to swings in the broad dollar index. The dollar beta is a risk factor in the sense that investors who bear dollar risk are compensated with higher expected stock returns.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our finding that the dollar return multiplier is larger than one in all EMEs implies that the dollar-denominated returns tend to be amplified versions of the local currency returns. When both the broad dollar index and the bilateral dollar exchange rate enter as explanatory variables in regressions for stock market returns in EMEs, the broad dollar index remains the more important determinant of stock returns. Finally, our finding that EME stock indices with a high dollar beta tend to have higher average returns ties in well with the notion that the broad dollar index is a useful indicator of "risk-on" and "risk-off" sentiment in global stock markets.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The financial channel of exchange rates operates through changes in risk-taking by investors and is reflected in the response of financial conditions to exchange rate movements. We show that stock returns also reflect the financial channel of exchange rates, with higher local currency stock returns associated with a weaker dollar. The broad dollar index emerges as a global factor, consistent with the financial channel operating through swings in risk-taking by global investors. We introduce the "dollar beta" as the sensitivity of stock returns to swings in the broad dollar index, and show that emerging market stock indices that have a higher dollar beta tend to have higher average returns, implying that the dollar beta is a cross-section risk factor that is priced.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>We investigate how far Chinese banks have managed to hide from regulators the risks associated with shadow loans on their balance sheets. We also consider if the financial market in China has priced in risks associated with such shadow loans. In particular, we ask if banks relying heavily on shadow lending have managed to keep funding costs from rising, and if investors in equity and bond markets have required higher returns for more vulnerable banks.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>Many recent papers have looked at the impact of China's shadow banking sector on financial stability and the real economy. However, they do not explore whether the financial market has priced in banks' hidden risks. This paper uses on-balance sheet shadow loan data for all major Chinese banks to test if individual banks were able to successfully window-dress their financial health. It also uses reverse stress-testing techniques to calculate a break-even non-performing loan (NPL) ratio incorporating shadow loans.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span>We find that the ratio of a bank's shadow loans to its net worth correlates negatively with its leverage ratio, but not with its risk-weighted capital ratio. This suggests that banks have managed to window-dress their regulatory capital ratios by using shadow loans. Nevertheless, financial market participants are aware of banks' vulnerabilities to shadow lending. In particular, banks with higher shadow loan ratios or lower break-even NPL ratios face higher wholesale funding costs. Their equity and bond returns are also lower after the announcement of a rare bank failure.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper examines how Chinese banks used on-balance sheet shadow loans for regulatory arbitrage and whether the financial market priced in the banks' use of shadow loans and the resulting vulnerabilities in 2016–2020. It finds that banks chose to window-dress their regulatory capital ratio by using shadow loans. It also shows that banks with a higher shadow loan ratio or a lower break-even non-performing loan ratio obtained from reverse stress testing faced higher wholesale funding costs. Finally, after the announcement of a rare bank failure event, more vulnerable banks witnessed lower cumulative stock and bond returns.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Information technology (IT) has dramatically changed how information is used in the financial sector. This may affect the supply of credit from banks, as a key function of banks is to screen and monitor borrowers. Lending to opaque borrowers, such as young firms and start-ups, is likely to be especially sensitive to such changes in IT. The reason is that young firms have not yet produced sufficient quantitative information, such as balance sheet data. Instead, lenders rely on soft information. As start-ups contribute disproportionately to job creation and productivity, but are often financially constrained, understanding how the IT revolution in banking has affected start-ups' access to finance is of paramount importance. Yet, direct evidence for the impact of lenders' IT capabilities on entrepreneurship is scarce.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>First, our paper relates to the literature investigating the effects of IT in the financial sector on credit provision and small businesses. Second, we speak to papers that analyse the importance of collateral for entrepreneurial activity. We provide first evidence that banks' IT adoption increases the importance of collateral in banks' financing of young firms. Third, we contribute to the recent literature that investigates how the rise of fintech affects credit-scoring and credit supply. An advantage of focusing on the variation in IT adoption among banks is that our results are unlikely to be explained by regulatory arbitrage, which has been shown to be an important driver of the growth of fintechs.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We build a model in which banks can screen firms either by acquiring information about firms and their projects or by requiring collateral. Crucially, IT makes it cheaper for banks to analyse hard information and thus rely on collateralised lending. This benefits start-ups, as they have not yet produced sufficient information and have to be screened through the use of collateral. The model thus predicts that IT in banking will spur entrepreneurship – and the more so when collateral value rises. Consistent with the model's implications, we find that job creation by start-ups is stronger in US counties with IT-intensive banks, especially during periods of rising collateral values.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper analyzes the importance of information technology (IT) in banking for entrepreneurship. To guide our analysis, we build a parsimonious model of bank screening and lending that predicts that IT in banking can spur entrepreneurship by making it easier for startups to borrow against collateral. We then empirical show that job creation by young firms is stronger in US counties that are more exposed to IT-intensive banks. Consistent with a strengthened collateral lending channel, entrepreneurship increases by more in IT-exposed counties when house prices rise. In line with the model's implications, higher startup activity does not diminish startup quality. Instrumental variable regressions at the bank level further show that IT makes banks' credit supply more responsive to changes in local house prices, and weakens the importance of geographical distance between borrowers and lenders. These results suggest that banks' IT adoption can increase dynamism by improving startups' access to finance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Interbank money markets are essential for banks' liquidity management. They are also important for monetary policy implementation as central banks often target interbank rates. Our paper focuses on two major and persistent money market developments that have occurred in the euro area over the past 15 years: the falling importance of the unsecured interbank market relative to the secured market and, relatedly, the rising exposure of banks to the risk of increases in collateral haircuts. We ask how these developments have affected bank lending, real activity and the conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our novel general equilibrium model features different kinds of banks, interbank markets for both secured and unsecured credit, and a central bank. The interaction between occasionally binding constraints, particularly on leverage and liquidity, are key in determining macroeconomic outcomes. We consider three different monetary policies: a pre-Great Financial Crisis policy characterised by a constant balance sheet, a policy of balance sheet expansion via collateralised credit operations, and a policy of outright asset purchases. We calibrate the model to euro area data so that we can study how the observed money market developments evolve under the different monetary policies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that frictions in the secured and unsecured money markets force banks to either divert resources into unproductive but liquid assets or to reduce leverage, thus reducing lending and economic output. When the share of banks with access to unsecured lending shrinks, the constant-balance sheet or collateralised credit operations policies act similarly, as there is no advantage in borrowing from the central bank as long as the private secured market functions smoothly. By contrast, outright asset purchases inject liquidity and alleviate liquidity constraints, which reduces the negative effects on output. If haircuts increase in the private markets, the key to mitigating the output drop is for the central bank to expand its balance sheet, thus easing the liquidity constraints. This can be achieved both via lending to banks against collateral with favourable haircuts, or via central bank purchases of government bonds.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Interbank money markets have been subject to substantial impairments in the recent decade, such as a decline in unsecured lending and substantial increases in haircuts on posted collateral. This paper seeks to understand the implications of these developments for the broader economy and monetary policy. To that end, we develop a novel general equilibrium model featuring heterogeneous banks, interbank markets for both secured and unsecured credit, and a central bank. The model features a number of occasionally binding constraints. The interactions between these constraints - in particular leverage and liquidity constraints - are key in determining macroeconomic outcomes. We find that both secured and unsecured money market frictions force banks to either divert resources into unproductive but liquid assets or to de-lever, which leads to less lending and output. If the liquidity constraint is very tight, the leverage constraint may turn slack. In this case, there are large declines in lending and output. We show how central bank policies which increase the size of the central bank balance sheet can attenuate this decline.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How market participants form expectations about future monetary policy is crucial to macroeconomics and finance. To investigate how financial markets price the outlook for monetary policy, we study the information about future monetary policy embedded in money market derivatives instruments such as fed funds (FF) futures and overnight index swaps (OIS). We find novel insights into how expectations about future monetary policy are formed, and we shed light on when and how market expectations diverge from subsequent central bank actions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We challenge the mainstream view that term premia drive excess returns on fed funds futures and OIS contracts. Instead, we highlight the role of expectation errors as being the main source of excess returns. We discover that, at least in normal times, fed funds futures and OIS are more reliable gauges of monetary policy expectations than previously appreciated. This finding rehabilitates the expectations hypothesis for short maturities. Finally, we study an international sample of several major central banks, which confirms our main findings.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that seemingly biased expectations and positive excess returns on Fed funds futures and OIS stem from market participants underestimating the size of the Fed's interest rate cuts in response to infrequent but large, negative shocks. These episodes are characterised by low stock returns and high uncertainty about the future course of monetary policy. Consequently, we show that falling stock returns predict subsequent excess returns on money market instruments. Higher stock prices by contrast do not predict rate hikes and subsequent low excess returns on money market instruments. The most plausible interpretation is that excess returns on fed funds futures and OIS stem from investors having underestimated by how much the central bank would ease in response to rare shocks accompanied by deteriorating financial conditions.  </p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>How are financial markets pricing the monetary policy outlook? We use survey expectations to decompose excess returns on money market instruments into term premia and expectation errors. We find excess returns to be driven primarily by expectation errors, whereas term premia are negligible. Our findings point to challenges faced by investors in learning about the Federal Reserve's response to large, but infrequent, negative shocks in real-time. Rather than reflecting risk compensation, excess returns stem from investors underestimating by how much the central bank has eased in response to such rare shocks. We document similar results in an international sample.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Credit losses evolve through distinct phases. After seemingly benign periods, they surge abruptly and stay elevated for some time before returning to a prolonged phase of low levels. The underlying mechanism for this has remained elusive, so creditors – notably, banks – have had to set their loss-absorbing resources under much uncertainty. The fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic has brought this uncertainty to the fore.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We extend the model behind the Basel III requirements for credit risk in order to incorporate uncertainty about the credit loss phase. This lets us distinguish between two sources of potential shortfalls in loss-absorbing resources: ignoring uncertainty, and the uncertainty itself. We study how the shortfall associated with each source depends on the level of diversification in a credit portfolio. We also propose a method to rank the level of diversification across portfolios.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Accounting for a rise in uncertainty about the credit risk phase results in a decoupling between expected losses, which underpin provisions, and unexpected losses, which drive capital. This is consistent with empirical forecasts of credit loss distributions from the standpoint of the first quarter in 2021.</p>
<p>We show that ignoring phase uncertainty or operating under greater such uncertainty leads to larger shortfalls of loss-absorbing resources – and hence a higher likelihood of bank failure – when the credit portfolio is more diversified. In such a portfolio, a common risk factor within a phase has a smaller scope to compensate for errors related to uncertainty about the phase.</p>
<p>Using data on US bank loans from 1985 to 2021, we find that in a credit loss phase a prototypical business loan portfolio is more diversified than a real estate portfolio.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A parsimonious extension of a well-known portfolio credit-risk model allows us to study a salient stylized fact – abrupt switches between high- and low-loss phases – from a risk-management perspective. As uncertainty about phase switches increases, expected losses decouple from unexpected losses, which reflect a high percentile of the loss distribution. Banks that ignore this decoupling have shortfalls of loss-absorbing resources, which is more detrimental if the portfolio is more diversified within a phase. Likewise, the risk-management benefits of improving phase-switch forecasts increase with diversification. The analysis of these findings leads us to an empirical method for comparing the degree of within-phase default clustering across portfolios.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Do foreign investors improve the quality of domestic institutions? This question is crucial to understanding how a country's capital inflows can spur or hinder economic growth.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To answer this question, existing studies have used aggregate data to examine if institutional reforms take place when capital inflows are high. However, this can establish only simple correlations. This paper solves this problem by using granular industry data. It also distinguishes across country groups and between different types of capital inflows. The paper applies a difference-in-difference methodology to 22 industries in 89 countries between 1985 and 2014. The aim is to understand how industries that depend on "good institutions" fare relative to their counterparts when a greater volume of foreign capital flows into the country. Good institutions mean effective contract enforcement and low corruption.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Industries that depend on good institutions grow more when more foreign capital comes into the country. We call this "the institutional quality channel" of capital flows. But this channel does not work when capital flows into the official sector instead of the private sector. Further, the channel does not work if the institutional quality in the recipient country is very low. Countries should implement certain structural reforms before opening their economy to foreign investors. </p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Does foreign capital improve the quality of domestic institutions? Consistent with an institutional quality channel of capital flows, we show that industries that are more dependent on "good" institutions to operate grow more than others after foreign capital flows into the private sector. The effects are stronger in countries that are further away from the institutional frontier (e.g., emerging markets), but they disappear and even turn negative in countries with very low initial institutional quality, suggesting that foreign capital inflows can exacerbate the ex-ante institutional deficit. We also find that institution-dependent industries grow less when capital flows to the official sector. Our findings support the view that foreign investors can be, under certain conditions, a catalyst for institutional reform and that the relaxation of government budget constraints generally weakens structural reform incentives.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Term premia are an important component of long-term interest rates and have become more relevant with unconventional monetary policies. Since households' and businesses' savings and spending decisions can be influenced by such rates, the study of the dynamics of long-term interest rates and term premia is relevant for central banks and financial policymakers. Longer-term rates can be expressed as the sum of the average of the current short-term interest rate and its expectations for the long term. Central banks can influence the short-term interest rate through monetary policy actions and its expectations through their communication strategy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper estimates the two components of long-term interest rates in Mexico: the expected short-term interest rate and the term premium. The first is obtained using different methodologies. The second is computed as the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates. The Mexican term premium is represented by the average of the three estimations.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results suggest that the main determinants of the evolution of the Mexican term premium are the US term premium as a global factor, real compensation and the compensation for FX risk as a proxy of the inflationary risk premium. We find that the Mexican term premium increased considerably during three episodes: (i) the Great Financial Crisis; (ii) the 2013 taper tantrum; and (iii) the 2016 US presidential election. In contrast, it decreased to historically low levels during the US quantitative easing programmes.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We estimate the term premium implicit in 10-year Mexican government bonds from 2004 to 2019, and analyze the main determinants explaining its dynamics. To do so, we decompose the long-term interest rate into its two components: the expected shortterm interest rate and the term premium. The first component is obtained using different methodologies, two affine models and data on interest rate swaps. The second component is computed as the difference between long-term interest rates and such short-term rate. The Mexican term premium is represented by the average of the three estimations. We find that the Mexican term premium increased considerably during three episodes compared to the entire dynamics of said premium: i) the Global Financial Crisis of 2008; ii) the Taper Tantrum of 2013; and iii) the U.S. presidential election of 2016. In contrast, we find that the Mexican term premium decreased, to historically low levels, during the U.S. Quantitative Easing and Operation Twist programs. Additionally, in order to identify the main determinants that explain the behavior of this premium, we run a time varying parameters regression. In this analysis, we find that the main determinants that explain the dynamics of the premium are the compensation for FX risk (as a proxy of inflationary risk premium), the real compensation, and the U.S. term premium (as a global factor).</p>

We examine these questions by combining a novel event study methodology with a rich data set on the exposures of European banks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We calculate a new measure of bank risk using a rich data set on banks' exposures to individual countries and sectors. We employ a novel methodology, which allows us to evaluate the impact of public data releases on bank equity prices and CDS spreads. Our empirical framework allows us to identify two effects of new information: the reduction of overall uncertainty and the update of investors' estimates of bank risk. We also investigate the impact of bank opacity on bank funding, lending and profitability.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that investors were not fully informed about bank lending portfolios. Bank equity prices and CDS spreads reacted strongly to public releases of data on banks' exposures. The impact of new data was highest for European periphery banks' sovereign exposures and European core banks' private sector exposures. Banks with underestimated credit risk had lower funding costs and borrowed more. If they were from the European periphery, such banks also made riskier loans and had higher profits.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate the patterns and implications of bank opacity in Europe using a rich bank-level data set. Employing a novel event study methodology, we document that public data releases by the European Banking Authority (EBA) on banks' exposures to individual countries and sectors contained information that was not previously priced by equity and CDS markets. We demonstrate that the degree of bank opacity varied considerably across bank nationalities and counterparty sectors – it was highest for European periphery banks' sovereign exposures and European core banks' private sector exposures. Furthermore, we document that underestimations of banks' credit risk by markets were associated with lower funding costs and higher wholesale borrowing (for all banks) as well as with greater risk taking and higher profitability (for European periphery banks).</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>We ask whether a central bank should turn aside from its objective of price stability to promote financial stability. We tackle this question within a textbook New Keynesian model augmented with capital accumulation and crises that originate within the financial system. We compare several interest rate rules, under which the central bank responds more or less forcefully to inflation and aggregate output.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>Our model departs from the textbook model in a few but important ways. Excess accumulation of capital may induce the economy to deviate persistently from its steady state, resulting in financial imbalances. Firms are subject to productivity shocks that lead to capital being reallocated between productive and unproductive firms via a credit market. Financial frictions make this credit market fragile and prone to sudden collapses ("financial crises") towards the end of investment booms.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span>Our main findings are, first, that monetary policy can make a financial crisis more or less likely both in the short run (through aggregate demand) and in the medium run (through savings and capital accumulation). Second, a central bank can make a crisis less likely, while increasing social welfare, by departing from strict inflation targeting and responding systematically to fluctuations in output. Third, financial crises may occur after a long period of unexpectedly loose monetary policy as the central bank abruptly reverses course.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study whether a central bank should deviate from its objective of price stability to promote financial stability. We tackle this question within a textbook New Keynesian model augmented with capital accumulation and microfounded endogenous financial crises. We compare several interest rate rules, under which the central bank responds more or less forcefully to inflation and aggregate output. Our main findings are threefold. First, monetary policy affects the probability of a crisis both in the short run (through aggregate demand) and in the medium run (through savings and capital accumulation). Second, a central bank can both reduce the probability of a crisis and increase welfare by departing from strict inflation targeting and responding systematically to fluctuations in output. Third, financial crises may occur after a long period of unexpectedly loose monetary policy as the central bank abruptly reverses course.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>While much research has examined the pros and cons of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), there has been less focus on the relative merits of CBDCs in particular economies or global regions. We attempt to fill that gap for the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We first examine LAC central banks' views towards CBDCs, drawing on their responses to a BIS survey, and the extent to which their engagement with CBDCs can be explained by their economies' structural characteristics. Next, we review potential costs and benefits of retail CBDCs, focusing on their relevance to the LAC economies. We also address the challenges to central banks in the region posed by foreign CBDCs or private digital currencies, which may be especially salient for LAC economies, given their significant currency substitution and capital flow volatility. Finally, we review the design choices made by LAC central banks that have issued a retail CBDC.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The interest of LAC central banks in CBDCs, like that of central banks in other emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), centres around promoting greater financial inclusion, efficiency, and safety of the payments system.</p>
<p>Our statistical analysis identifies important drivers of engagement in CBDC development: the extent of innovation, the presence of fast payment systems, government effectiveness, financial account ownership, financial development more generally and the extent of the public's interest in CBDCs.</p>
<p>We highlight CBDCs' potential to spur competition and reduce costs in the payment system, which are especially high in many LAC economies. CBDCs could also diminish the threat to monetary sovereignty from private digital currencies, promote financial inclusion and reduce informality.</p>
<p>An important concern for LAC economies is that CBDCs could lead to capital outflows and currency volatility. This concern can be addressed through limits on the use of CBDCs, foreign exchange regulations and cooperation with authorities in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>An unusually high number of LAC central banks – five – have developed pilot or more permanent CBDCs. Most use a "hybrid" model involving both central banks and private firms.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The pros and cons of CBDCs have been examined in numerous writings. However, much less research has focused on the benefits, costs and implementation issues of CBDCs in specific economies or regions. This paper attempts to fill that gap for the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) economies. It first examines the views of central banks in the region toward CBDCs, drawing on their responses to a survey conducted by the BIS in late 2020 and early 2021. Second, it examines whether the engagement of LAC central banks with CBDCs can be explained by the structural characteristics of their economies. Third, it reviews the long list of potential benefits, costs and risks of CBDCs, focusing on their relevance to the LAC economies. Finally, the paper reviews the design choices that central banks face and the actual choices made by a number of central banks in the region.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We test two theories of banking competition. The first is the market power hypothesis, which claims that higher market power leads to financial constraints and wider spreads. The second is the information hypothesis, which argues that banks need some market power to offset their lack of knowledge of borrowers ( "information asymmetry") in lending markets. According to the information hypothesis, less competition induces banks to engage in relationship lending. In this way, banks might obtain more soft information and so reduce the effects of information asymmetry. On this view, increased competition would lessen the attractiveness of relationships and increase the cost of credit.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We analyse more than 13 million loans by private sector banks to firms in Brazil from 2005 to 2016. The use of loan-level data lets us better disentangle demand and supply factors. It also lets us identify shocks more accurately than in previous work, as we have information on the bank-firm relationship over time. Furthermore, we use a competition measure – the Lerner index – at a bank instead of a country-wide level. This lets our study benefit from variation both across banks and through time.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results show a direct relationship between the market power of private banks and spreads. They show that less competition increases the cost of firm financing, in line with the market power hypothesis. Another key finding is to demonstrate that banks follow a "capture then extract rents" strategy in Brazil. Banks first capture some of their clients by offering lower interest rates, later increasing these rates as the relationship evolves. This suggests that it pays banks to keep firms as clients, to avoid any informational switching costs. This evidence argues against the information hypothesis. On this view, policy responses seeking to foster information-sharing may help to reduce switching costs and hence alleviate the effects of lock-in.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies the links between competition in the lending market and spreads of bank loans in Brazil. Evidence from a dataset of more than 13 million loan-level observations from private banks shows a positive relationship between market power, measured by the Lerner index, and the cost of finance, measured by loan spreads over the treasury curve. Furthermore, there is evidence of the holdup problem, originating from informational switching costs faced by firms. Private banks engage in a strategy of first competing fiercely for clients by offering a lower loan interest rate and later increasing interest rates as the bank-firm relationship duration increases. Both results are stronger for micro and small firms than for medium and large firms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>State-contingent debt instruments (SCDIs) have many theoretical benefits. For instance, they reduce interest payment burden in recessions and provide fiscal space when a shock hits the economy. But the use of SCDIs is limited in practice. Despite renewed interest during the Covid-19 pandemic, we know very little about the empirical properties of these instruments.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper fills this gap in the literature by examining GDP-linked warrants issued by Argentina, Greece and Ukraine. It is the first to document the evolution of the SCDI risk premium over a long period of time and for multiple countries. The aim is to understand how SCDIs differ from plain vanilla bonds in terms of their pricing and volatility. For this purpose, the paper presents a general framework to price SCDIs. It then documents how the premium on SCDIs has evolved in the three country cases. It also develops a simple model to explain the documented properties of this premium.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The SCDI premium is high and persistent. It averages 12.5%, 4.25% and 6.65% for Argentina, Greece and Ukraine, respectively. The SCDI premium exhibits a procyclical pattern. In other words, it is lower when the economy is in a recession. Finally, the liquidity premium on SCDIs is higher and more volatile than those for plain vanilla bonds. A model in which investors fear ambiguity could explain these patterns. </p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>State-contingent debt instruments such as GDP-linked warrants have garnered attention as a potential tool to help debt-stressed economies smooth repayments over business cycles, yet very few studies of the empirical properties of these instruments exist. This paper develops a general framework to estimate the time-varying risk premium of a state-contingent sovereign debt instrument. Our estimation framework applied to GDP-linked warrants issued by Argentina, Greece, and Ukraine reveals three stylized facts: (i) the risk premium in state-contingent instruments is high and persistent; (ii) the risk premium exhibits a pro-cyclical pattern; and (iii) the liquidity premium is higher and more volatile than that for plain-vanilla government bonds issued by the same sovereign. We then present a model in which investors fear ambiguity and that can account for the cyclical properties of the risk premium.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>For more than a decade, many central banks have engaged in unconventional monetary policy. How do these actions affect economic activity, including through firms' investment decisions?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper offers a corporate finance perspective on the effects and limitations of unconventional monetary policy. The analysis uses detailed data on Japanese banks and firms between 2004 and 2015. This is an interesting case because the Bank of Japan has a longer history of unconventional monetary policy than other major central banks. Noting that unconventional monetary policy affects the yield curve, the paper uses lower term premia as proxy for monetary easing. The granularity of the data allows the effect of the term premia to be identified through fixed effects. It also reveals differences in the investment patterns of financially vulnerable firms (the so-called zombies) and healthier firms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Firms increase investment in response to lower term premia. But this response comes primarily from healthy firms. By contrast, zombies seem to respond to monetary easing by financial restructuring. They basically replace short-term debt with long-term debt. That way, they take advantage of lower long-term yields without increasing investment. Unconventional monetary policy might have a diminishing effect on firm investment in an economy with many zombies.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>How does unconventional monetary policy affect corporate capital structure and investment decisions? We study the transmission channel of quantitative easing and its potential diminishing returns on investment from a corporate finance perspective. Using a rich bankfirm matched data of Japanese firms with information on corporate debt and investment, we study how firms adjust their capital structure in response to the changes in term premia. Investment responds positively to a reduction in the term premium on average. However, there is a significant degree of cross-sectional variation in firm response: healthier firms increase capital spending and cash holdings, while financially vulnerable firms take advantage of lower long-term yields to refinance without increasing investment.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p class="Paragraph" style="text-indent: 0cm;"><span>New players in finance include fintech and big tech firms with digital platforms in e-commerce, search or social media. Increasingly, incumbent financial institutions are also adopting platform-based business models. Digital platforms operate in multi-sided markets, using big data to match different groups of customers (eg users and providers). This paper assesses how these models can affect financial inclusion, competition, financial stability and consumer protection. </span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>We apply insights from the theory of platform economics to the experience with digital platforms, considering their impact on policy objectives. We show that </span>the same forces that help platforms to lower costs and enhance financial inclusion can also give rise to digital monopolies. We document the rise of digital platforms in selected financial services around the world, including both progress on financial inclusion and the new policy concerns around competition, financial stability and consumer protection. We assess three broad policy approaches to harness the benefits of digital platforms while mitigating policy risks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that platforms have helped to achieve impressive gains in financial inclusion, both in emerging market and developing economies and in advanced economies such as the United Kingdom. We also show evidence of the tendency of digital platforms to dominate specific markets. We argue that an ex ante policy approach to competition, data portability and public infrastructures (eg for digital identity, retail fast payments and potentially central bank digital currencies) can be promising. We argue that regardless of the approach chosen, coordination by central banks and financial regulators with competition and data protection authorities is warranted.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Three types of digital platforms are expanding in financial services: (i) fintech entrants; (ii) big tech firms; and (iii) increasingly, incumbent financial institutions with platformbased business models. These platforms can dramatically lower costs and thereby aid financial inclusion – but these same features can give rise to digital monopolies and oligopolies. Digital platforms operate in multi-sided markets, and rely crucially on big data. This leads to specific network effects, returns to scale and scope, and policy trade-offs. To reap the benefits of platforms while mitigating risks, policy makers can: (i) apply existing financial, antitrust and privacy regulations, (ii) adapt old and adopt new regulations, combining an activity and entity-based approach, and/or (iii) provide new public infrastructures. The latter include digital identity, retail fast payment systems and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These public infrastructures, as well as ex ante competition rules and data portability, are particularly promising. Yet to achieve their policy goals, central banks and financial regulators need to coordinate with competition and data protection authorities.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>An increasing share of investors and asset managers are looking for ways to trim the carbon footprint of their investments. We describe simple approaches that will help a passive investor make such reductions, whether in a world-wide or a regional portfolio of stocks. Of particular interest is whether investors would need to divest away from emerging market economies or high-emissions sectors such as energy, utilities and cement to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We analyse simple allocation rules that exclude corporates whose carbon footprint is above a given threshold for any given year, with the aim of meeting the investor's targeted emissions reductions. We report how many stocks are excluded and assess various ways of reinvesting the proceeds. We then compare the financial performance of the business-as-usual benchmarks with that of our alternative net zero-consistent ones.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that a passive investor could have cut the carbon emissions of their portfolio by 10% every year for the past 10 years with relative ease and without changing its country or sectoral exposure. A cumulated reduction of 64% of carbon emissions with respect to the 2010 MSCI global stock portfolio could be reached in 2019 by excluding about 11% of the most polluting corporates, which collectively account for 6% of market capitalisation, and without reducing exposure to any one country or sector. The returns and Sharpe ratio of the business-as-usual MSCI benchmark and the alternative net zero-consistent ones are almost identical.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper, we build portfolios with a progressively falling carbon footprint, which passive investors could use as a new Paris-consistent (PC) benchmark while keeping their risk-adjusted returns at the same level as those of business-as-usual (BAU) benchmarks. We identify the worst polluters globally, exclude them from the portfolio, and re allocate the proceeds so as to keep sectoral and regional exposures similar to those of the business as usual (BAU) benchmark. This approach limits the divestment from corporates in emerging market economies that would result from implementing exclusions and reinvestment without the objective of preserving regional exposures. We show that reducing the carbon footprint of the portfolio by 64% in 10 years could be achieved by sequentially excluding up to 11% of the corporates, which together amount to less than 6% of the global market portfolio. While this reallocation keeps regional and sectoral exposures at a similar level to those of the BAU benchmark, it does not change the portfolio's risk-adjusted return. We define PC benchmark portfolios at the global level as well as for Emerging Countries, Europe, North America, and the Pacific.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Globally, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have patchy access to finance. Due to the important economic role of these firms, especially as employers, governments subsidise and support SMEs generously. Research has shown that subsidies help SMEs to grow in size. However, it is not well understood if subsidies take effect by making credit more available, or by cutting the cost of funding. Moreover, it is also not obvious if a subsidy-led growth in assets will translate into higher sales, profitability or productivity. On the one hand, if a firm has good investment ideas but cannot obtain financing due to a short credit history (eg young firms) or the lack of collateral (eg small firms), then a subsidy can help it overcome a relevant constraint. On the other hand, if the firm has no worthwhile projects or is poorly managed, the credit constraint may simply reflect these other shortcomings, which subsidies may not help resolve.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper uses a unique combination of data sets (including the credit register) from Hungary to help fill these gaps in the literature. A novelty of our approach is that we directly identify credit-constrained firms – ie businesses that applied for a loan but were refused. Classifying firms as credit-constrained (CC) and not constrained (NC) is the key to disentangling the two channels through which subsidies can work. It also helps to assess if CC firms benefit more or less from subsidies than do NC firms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that subsidies do lead to a significant incremental lift in the asset growth of CC firms relative to that of NC firms. Since subsidies provide both groups with cheap capital, the incremental effect shows that an "easing of the financial constraint" channel is at work for CC firms. However, this effect fades after a few years. Moreover, we find no incremental effect on broader measures of firm performance. This suggests that banks may be less willing to lend to such firms for valid reasons concerning their future prospects and credit risk. Thus, on average, a lack of funding does not seem to be keeping SMEs behind, at least in Hungary.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We assess the effects of non-repayable subsidies on financially constrained and unconstrained Hungarian SMEs. Using rejected subsidy applicants as control group and bank queries to the credit-registry to identify firms that applied for but did not receive a loan, we show that subsidies generate a sizeable incremental impact on asset growth of constrained firms relative to unconstrained businesses. This effect, however, is transitory and does not translate into higher sales, profitability or productivity. Financing, therefore, may not be the primary hurdle for these SMEs, and credit constraints may reflect other shortcomings, such as lack of good management or viable projects.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Interest rates in many countries have been exceptionally and persistently low for over a decade now. Despite these very low rates and aggressive monetary policy easing, the strength of the economy has been disappointing. We ask whether this outcome implies that monetary policy has become less effective in stimulating aggregate expenditure.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Based on a panel of 18 advanced economies starting in 1985, we examine whether aggregate demand becomes less responsive to changes in the monetary policy stance ("shocks") when interest rates are low and whether its response weakens over time when they stay low. In doing so, we control for confounding factors, notably the state of the business cycle, debt levels and a possible trend decline in equilibrium interest rates. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that monetary transmission to economic activity is substantially weaker when interest rates are low. We also find evidence that the effectiveness of monetary policy wanes the longer interest rates stay low. As a result, monetary policy trade-offs may have become more challenging.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Are there limits to how far reductions in interest rates can boost aggregate demand? In particular, as interest rates fall to very low levels, does the effectiveness of monetary policy in boosting the economy wane? We provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Based on a panel of 18 advanced countries starting in 1985, we find that monetary transmission to economic activity is substantially weaker when interest rates are low. The results hold even when controlling for potential confounding non-linearities associated with debt levels and the business cycle as well as for the trend decline in equilibrium interest rates. We also find evidence that the effectiveness of monetary policy wanes the longer interest rates stay low. These findings suggest that the observed flattening of the Phillips curve has gone hand in hand with a corresponding steepening of the IS curve. Monetary policy trade-offs may have become more challenging.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The concept of the natural rate of interest, or r-star (r*), has risen to prominence in monetary policy following the Great Financial Crisis. R-star is the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate that equilibrates output at potential, so that inflation is stable. How useful is this concept as a guide to policy?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The lecture offers an in-depth critical evaluation of the concept, from theoretical, empirical and practical perspectives. Based on that, it draws policy conclusions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, since r-star can be estimated only very imprecisely, it can largely be dispensed with when adjusting the policy stance. That said, the notion can still help shape the monetary policy framework and strategy more generally. Second, because of its defining features and depending on how it is employed, r-star has the potential to lead policy astray. In particular, the view that r-star is independent of monetary policy and not much affected by purely financial factors could contribute to a progressive loss of policy room for manoeuvre and complicate the task of regaining it. Finally, should these propositions be valid, there would be a case for greater flexibility within credible policy regimes, – ie tolerance for transitory, but possibly persistent, deviations of inflation from narrowly defined targets. This flexibility could help in adopting a more countercyclical monetary policy strategy and hence also in regaining policy headroom, possibly through a kind of "opportunistic tightening" strategy.  </p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The concept of the natural rate of interest, or r*, has risen to prominence in monetary policy following the Great Financial Crisis. No doubt a key reason for the concept's newfound prominence has been the further decline of real and nominal interest rates to new lows, which has further constrained monetary policy's room for manoeuvre. This lecture explores the extent to which the concept can be a useful guide to policy. It concludes that, depending on how it is employed, the concept has the potential of leading policy astray and of complicating the task of regaining the needed policy headroom. If so, within a credible policy regime, there is a premium on flexibility in the pursuit of tightly defined inflation targets – on tolerance for transitory, but possibly persistent, shortfalls of inflation from target.</p>

<p>The central banking community faces daunting challenges, which may well define the future of the central bank as an institution for years to come. These entwined challenges are economic, intellectual and institutional. This lecture focuses on the intellectual challenge, ie the facts on the ground are increasingly testing the long-standing analytical paradigms on which central banks may rely to inform their policies. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The lecture examines the intellectual challenge from a holistic perspective, considering its evolution, causes and implications. In so doing, it critically revisits beliefs so ingrained that they are often taken as self-evident, even though they have not always been regarded as such. Are these beliefs fully justified?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In the years ahead, rebuilding room for policy manoeuvre – monetary buffers – will be essential. Regaining such safety margins is critical to allow monetary policy to fulfil its mandate effectively – tackling price, macroeconomic and, hence, financial instability. Three beliefs may complicate this task. First, economic fluctuations reflect exogenous shocks rather than inherently unstable dynamics. Second, monetary policy has only a transient impact on the real economy ("money neutrality") and hence also the real (inflation-adjusted) rate of interest (the "natural rate of interest"). Third, the costs of persistent falls in the price level – deflation – are large. These beliefs may be less justified than normally thought.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The central banking community is facing major challenges – economic, intellectual and institutional. A key economic challenge is the need to rebuild room for policy manoeuvre, which has fallen drastically over time. This lecture focuses on the intellectual challenge, ie facts on the ground are increasingly testing the longstanding analytical paradigms on which central banks can rely to inform their policies. It argues that certain deeply held beliefs underpinning those paradigms can complicate the task of regaining policy headroom.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Which are the key drivers of inflation, and what role do expectations play in the inflation process have been long-standing questions in macroeconomics, particularly given their relevance to economic policymaking. This paper sheds some fresh light on these central questions using machine learning.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>I examine inflation in 20 advanced economies since 2000 through the lens of a flexible data-driven method. Beyond comparing explanatory performance with more traditional econometric methods, as far as possible, I also interpret the predicted relations between explanatory variables and consumer price inflation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The machine learning model predicts headline and core CPI inflation relatively well, even when only a small standard set of macroeconomic indicators is used. Inflation prediction errors are smaller than with standard OLS models using the same set of explanatory variables – which are firmly grounded on economic theory. Expectations emerge as the most important predictor of CPI inflation. That said, the relative importance of expectations has declined during the last 10 years.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper examines the drivers of CPI inflation through the lens of a simple, but computationally intensive machine learning technique. More specifically, it predicts inflation across 20 advanced countries between 2000 and 2021, relying on 1,000 regression trees that are constructed based on six key macroeconomic variables. This agnostic, purely data driven method delivers (relatively) good outcome prediction performance. Out of sample root mean square errors (RMSE) systematically beat even the in-sample benchmark econometric models, with a 28% RMSE reduction relative to a naïve AR(1) model and a 8% RMSE reduction relative to OLS. Overall, the results highlight the role of expectations for inflation outcomes in advanced economies, even though their importance appears to have declined somewhat during the last 10 years.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>Ranging from business development companies to insurance companies, direct lenders have become increasingly active in corporate loan markets. We investigate the role that these non-bank credit intermediaries play in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. As direct lenders become more prominent, their response to monetary policy will have a growing influence on how monetary policy affects the real economy.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>Lending by direct lenders seems to respond less sensitively to monetary policy than bank lending does in the syndicated loan market. We ask if this reflects a weaker influence from either the bank lending channel or the financial accelerator channel of monetary policy. Differences in leverage, maturity mismatch and lending technology all suggest that monetary policy may have an influence on direct lending that differs from its more widely studied effects on banks.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span>We find that direct lenders are more likely to join syndicates when monetary policy announcements trigger a decline in the aggregate stock market valuation of firms. This occurs whether short-term interest rates rise or fall. This suggests that direct lenders smooth the financial accelerator channel but not the bank lending channel of monetary policy. We conclude that this could reflect the low leverage of direct lenders, or differences in their lending technology. Either or both of these factors would let them keep on lending to firms when corporate sector net worth worsens, just as banks start cutting back.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Direct lenders, non-bank credit intermediaries with low leverage, have become increasingly important players in corporate loan markets. In this paper we investigate the role they play in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, using syndicated loan data covering the 2000-2018 period. We show that direct lenders are more likely to join loan syndicates whenever monetary policy announcements trigger a contraction in borrowers' net worth irrespective of the directional change in interest rates. Thus, our findings suggest that direct lenders dampen the financial accelerator channel of monetary policy.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Do financial crises fan the flames of fanaticism? Many have argued that the financial crisis of 2007–09 not only wrought havoc on employment and output but that its problematic aftermath of failing financial institutions, public bailouts and austerity may also have paved the way for populists around the world. We examine the canonical case of a radical movement's rise to power: Hitler's Nazi party, which took office in the wake of the severe 1931 banking crisis in Germany – a turning point in modern history.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Several cross-country studies have concluded that a link exists between financial crises and right-wing populist movements. What is still missing are studies demonstrating that a financial shock can lead to a broad-based radicalisation of the electorate, with major political consequences. It has also remained unclear how economic and financial shocks interact with cultural identity in the turn toward radicalisation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Using newly collected data on the exposure of individual cities to the failure of Danatbank – the bank at the heart of Germany's 1931 financial crisis – we show that a financial shock led to a generalised radicalisation of the electorate. This directly helped the Nazi party to gain power. Importantly, we demonstrate that the financial shock interacted with pre-existing cultural attitudes: the surge in support for the Nazis in response to the shock was greatest in places with a previous history of antisemitism. Voters were radicalised both at the ballot box and in their actions. Once the Nazis were in power, both pogroms and deportations were more likely to occur in places worse affected by the banking crisis.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Do financial crises radicalize voters? We study Germany's 1931 banking crisis, collecting new data on bank branches and firm-bank connections. Exploiting cross- sectional variation in pre-crisis exposure to the bank at the center of the crisis, we show that Nazi votes surged in locations more affected by its failure. Radicalization in response to the shock was exacerbated in cities with a history of anti- Semitism. After the Nazis seized power, both pogroms and deportations were more frequent in places affected by the banking crisis. Our results suggest an important synergy between financial distress and cultural predispositions, with far-reaching consequences.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>At the 2021 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), leaders from around the globe reached consensus on key actions to address climate change. These include rules that will govern the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C (ideally 1.5°C) since pre-industrial times, and will provide funding to help countries to adapt to climate change. Studying how firms' organisational structure can affect climate change is thus relevant for policymakers. We hypothesise that women in managerial positions may be better suited than male managers to reducing firm CO2 emissions. Our hypothesis finds support in the literature which suggests that women are more inclined to counter climate change as they may be more likely to consider overall societal well-being without focusing narrowly on shareholders' interest.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Contrary to previous studies that investigate how female board directors can influence firm CO2 emissions, we look at women managers' role. Board decisions shape firms' environmental approach, but managers select the suitable strategy to achieve the objectives. It follows that if female managers are more inclined towards environmental protection than their male peers, then firms with more female managers are likely to reduce their CO2 emissions more.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Using data for around 2,000 listed companies in 24 industrialised economies over the period 2009–19, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the share of female managers leads to a 0.5% decrease in CO2 emissions. This effect is robust controlling for institutional differences due to culture and religion. At the same time, we show that gender diversity at the managerial level has stronger mitigating effects on climate change if women are also well represented outside the organisation. Finally, we find that, after the Paris Agreement, firms with greater gender diversity at the management level reduced their CO2 emissions by about 5% more than firms with more male managers.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Does having more women in managerial positions improve firm environmental performance? We match firm-corporate governance characteristics with firm-level carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the period 2009-2019 to study the relationship between gender diversity in the workplace and firm carbon emissions. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the percentage of female managers within the firm leads to a 0.5% decrease in CO2 emissions. We document that this effect is statistically significant, also when controlling for institutional differences caused by more patriarchal and hierarchical cultures and religions. At the same time, we show that gender diversity at the managerial level has stronger mitigating effects on climate change if females are also well-represented outside the organization, e.g. in political institutions and civil society organizations. Finally, we find that, after the Paris Agreement, firms with greater gender diversity reduced their CO2 emissions by about 5% more than firms with more male managers. Overall, our results indicate that gender diversity within organizations can have a significant impact in combating climate change.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>A growing academic literature examines the economic implications of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The main focus is on their "reserves for all" aspect and the balance sheet issues for central banks, as well as the implications for monetary policy and financial stability. By contrast, in policy circles, the emphasis is on designing CBDCs to achieve public policy goals within the current two-tier payment system. This implies a division of labour between the public and private sector, thus keeping the footprint of the central bank limited.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We bridge the academic and policy perspectives on CBDCs. The paper gives a guided tour of the growing literature on the operational architectures for CBDCs, focusing on the technologies and the implications for privacy. We further examine the macroeconomic implications for the financial system, financial stability and monetary policy. We highlight issues for future research.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>By issuing CBDCs, central banks will aim to improve the current two-tier payment system. The policy goals include payments inclusion and efficiency, as well as safeguarding competition, data privacy and payment system integrity. In this way, CBDCs respond to the digitalisation of the economy and the key role of data in the monetary system.</p>
<p>Regarding the macroeconomic implications of CBDCs, the literature focuses on three main themes: the effects of CBDC issuance on bank lending, their implications for financial stability, and their use as a new monetary policy tool.</p>
<p>Important questions remain open on CBDCs and cross-border payments, areas in which policy development is moving beyond the research stage. Here, research insights could inform the design and international coordination of CBDC projects. The challenges include understanding the international implications of CBDC issuance for issuing and receiving countries, and how CBDCs might improve cross-border payments and help to integrate (digital) economies.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In just a few years, central banks have rapidly ramped up their research and development effort on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). A growing body of economic research informs these activities, often focusing on the "reserves for all" aspect of CBDCs for retail use. However, CBDCs should be considered in the full context of the digital economy and the centrality of data, which raises concerns around competition, payment system integrity and privacy. This paper gives a guided tour of the growing literature on CBDCs on the microeconomic considerations related to operational architectures, technologies and privacy, and the macroeconomic implications for the financial system, financial stability and monetary policy. A set of questions, particularly on the cross-border dimensions of CBDCs, remains unresolved, and calls for further work to expand the research frontier.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown steadily over the past decade and as of early 2021 managed more than $1.2 trillion. We illustrate that the specifics of the bond market lead to different arbitrage mechanics of bond ETFs relative to traditionally studied equity ETFs. Bond ETF baskets (the set of assets used to create or redeem ETF shares) contain a small fraction of holdings – a fact we refer to as "fractional baskets". This fact challenges the common assumption that baskets are representative of holdings, and has important implications for the ETF arbitrage process. We argue that fractional baskets may be a feature of ETFs holding illiquid assets since they create a buffer between the ETF market and the underlying bond market. We also show that ETFs can avoid fire sales through the action of authorised participants.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a new methodology to infer baskets. Second, we show that baskets are only a fraction of holdings, which makes the arbitrage mechanism of bond ETFs different from that of equity ETFs. We illustrate that fractional baskets can create persistent ETF premia and discounts. This finding suggests that volatility effects associated with arbitrage trading in equity ETFs, and documented in previous studies, may be muted in bond ETFs. Third, we argue that fractional baskets for ETFs holding illiquid bonds can be beneficial at times of stress by allowing authorised participants to act as a buffer and prevent fire sales.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We document several new facts. First, we find that roughly 10% of holdings are in creation baskets and 20% are in redemption baskets for ETFs holding corporate bonds. This is in stark contrast to ETFs holding equities and Treasuries, where ETF baskets are close to 100% of holdings. Second, corporate bond ETFs' baskets have high turnover. Third, we find that creation (redemption) baskets tend to have longer (shorter) durations and smaller (larger) bid-ask spreads relative to holdings. Finally, we develop a model which shows that ETFs may be more effective at managing illiquid assets than mutual funds.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We document several novel facts about exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding corporate bonds. First, the portfolio of bonds that are exchanged for new or existing ETF shares (called creation or redemption baskets) often represents a small fraction of ETF holdings – a fact that we call "fractional baskets." Second, creation and redemption baskets exhibit high turnover. Third, creation (redemption) baskets tend to have longer (shorter) durations and smaller (larger) bid-ask spreads relative to holdings. Lastly, ETFs with fractional baskets exhibit persistent premiums and discounts, which is related to the slow adjustment of NAV returns to ETF returns. We develop a simple model to show that an ETF's authorized participants (APs) can act as a buffer between the ETF market and the underlying illiquid assets, and help mitigate fire sales. Our findings suggest that ETFs may be more effective in managing illiquid assets than mutual funds.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Why have global real interest rates fallen so much? A common explanation is that factors such as shifting demographics and falling potential growth depress the natural interest rate, or r-star. This view has striking policy implications: central banks have no choice but to lower interest rates to keep their economies in balance. After all, they cannot control the natural interest rate. Extraordinary monetary policy and recent policy framework reviews can be seen as part of the strategy to combat the decline in r-star.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our new hypothesis links the fall in real interest rates to monetary policy itself. We employ the standard New Keynesian framework, but assume that information about the drivers of r-star is incomplete. The central bank learns about r-star from macroeconomic outcomes, while the private sector also learns from the central bank's policy actions. This simple and realistic model ties r-star to a learning process, which in our setup is shaped by how the central bank conducts its policy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that the natural interest rate can decline persistently even if there is no change in saving preferences or potential growth. The driving force is a positive learning feedback. The private sector interprets monetary policy easing as a signal from the central bank that the natural rate has fallen, leading to a lower aggregate demand than otherwise. The central bank interprets lower demand as a sign of falling r-star and cuts the policy interest rate, perpetuating the misperception. Both sides stare into a "hall of mirrors" and confuse the effects of their own actions with useful information. We calibrate the model and show that the hall of mirrors effect can explain most of the fall in real interest rates since the Great Financial Crisis.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Prevailing justifications of low-for-long interest rates appeal to a secular decline in the natural interest rate, or r-star, due to factors outside monetary policy's control. We propose informational feedback via learning as an alternative explanation for persistently low rates, where monetary policy plays a crucial role. We extend the canonical New Keynesian model to an incomplete information setting where the central bank and the private sector must learn about r-star and infer each other's information from observed macroeconomic outcomes. An informational feedback loop emerges when each side underestimates the effect of its own action on the other's inference, leading to large and persistent changes in perceived r-star disconnected from fundamentals. Monetary policy, through its influence on the private sector's beliefs, endogenously determines r-star as a result. We simulate a calibrated model and show that this 'hall of mirrors' effect can explain much of the decline in real interest rates since 2008.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Physical cash and commercial bank money are dominant vehicles for retail payments around the world, including in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Yet payments in EMDEs are marked by several key deficiencies – such as a lack of universal access to transaction accounts, widespread informality, limited competition and high costs, particularly for cross-border payments. New digital money proposals seek to address these deficiencies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We categorise new digital money proposals, such as cryptoassets, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). We assess the supply and demand factors that may determine in which countries these innovations are more likely to be adopted. We lay out particular policy challenges for authorities in EMDEs. Finally, we compare these proposals with digital innovations such as mobile money, retail fast payment systems, new products by incumbent financial institutions and new entrants such as specialised cross-border money transfer operators.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The distinction between central bank and non-central bank money is fundamental: central bank money is provided as a public good, and for this reason CBDCs are categorically different than private cryptoassets and stablecoins. While some of the factors that may drive their adoption are similar, their consequences would be very different. For EMDEs, new forms of digital money could pose specific development, macroeconomic and cross-border challenges. Yet technological advances built on the existing financial plumbing are already enhancing inclusion and efficiency in EMDEs. Taken together, perhaps the most important contribution of new private digital currencies so far is to draw greater – and welcome – attention to the challenges to financial inclusion and cross-border payments and remittances in EMDEs.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Proposals for global stablecoins have put a much-needed spotlight on deficiencies in financial inclusion and cross-border payments and remittances in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Yet stablecoin initiatives are no panacea. While they may achieve adoption in certain EMDEs, they may also pose particular development, macroeconomic and cross-border challenges for these countries and have not been tested at scale. Several EMDE authorities are weighing the potential costs and benefits of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). We argue that the distinction between token-based and account-based money matters less than the distinction between central bank and non-central bank money. Fast-moving fintech innovations that are built on or improve the existing financial plumbing may address many of the issues in EMDEs that both private stablecoins and CBDCs aim to tackle.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The heft of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) in the financial system has grown significantly since the Great Financial Crisis. We look at the main drivers and consequences of their ascent, focusing on NBFIs' effect on the demand for and supply of liquidity. We develop a framework of systemic-risk propagation through NBFIs that allows us to provide a unified reading of market disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a risk accounting framework that describes how NBFIs' risk-taking capacity evolves during periods of market distress. The key element of our setup is that fluctuations in leverage, due to changes in margins, can rapidly affect the amount of financial intermediation NBFIs perform. This perspective is useful to understand episodes of sudden liquidity disruptions in markets where NBFIs are major participants.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>NBFIs' prominent role has brought benefits by diversifying funding sources, but it has also exacerbated some liquidity imbalances that can, in extreme cases, endanger financial stability. Our framework implies that sharp increases in margins, especially after a protracted period of thin margins, will tighten financial conditions for the system as a whole. It also points to a tight link between deleveraging and "dash for cash", as during the Covid-19 pandemic. The systemic relevance of NBFIs raises questions about the appropriate policy strategies. In particular, there is an important correspondence between access to public resources and oversight.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The heft of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) has grown significantly after the Great Financial Crisis. This paper reviews structural shifts in intermediation and how NBFIs have shaped the demand and supply of liquidity in financial markets. We then lay out a framework for the key channels of systemic-risk propagation in the presence of NBFIs, emphasising the central role of leverage fluctuations through changes in margins. An investor's debt capacity is increasing in that of other investors in the system, so that leverage enables greater leverage, and spikes in margins can lead to system-wide deleveraging. In our framework, deleveraging and 'dash for cash' scenarios (as during the Covid-19 crisis) emerge as two sides of the same coin, rather than being two distinct stress propagation channels. These findings have implications for the design of NBFI regulations and of central bank backstops.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Using a small open economy model with long-term bonds, we ask whether term premia affect the inflation rate and the economy via the exchange rate. We focus in particular on the observation that uncovered interest rate parity holds better for long-term interest rate differentials. As term premia are the gap between long-term interest rates and the future path of short-term interest rates, this observation suggests that changes in term premia may influence the exchange rate and thus affect inflation and the real economy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To account for the uncovered interest rate parity observation, we make two assumptions. First, that households do not invest in foreign bonds and save only by investing in domestic short- and long-term bonds. Second, that bond investors do not trade short-term domestic and foreign bonds but only long-term domestic and foreign bonds. These lead to two consequences: first, they make the model consistent with the observation for uncovered interest rate parity. Second, they allow term premia to influence inflation and the real economy via exchange rate changes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We estimate the model parameters using data for the Japanese and US economies. We find that the decline in US term premia put downward pressure on the Japanese inflation rate through the yen's appreciation against the US dollar since 2008. However, since 2013, the fall in Japan's term premia, induced by the Bank of Japan's easing policy, has raised inflation by weakening the exchange rate. Hence, the quantitative results imply that the exchange rate has been affected by both US and Japanese term premia, leading to appreciable effects on Japan's inflation.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The macroeconomic effect of term premiums is a controversial issue both theoretically and quantitatively. In this paper, we explore the possibility that term premiums affect inflation and the real economy via exchange rate dynamics. For this purpose, we construct a small open economy model with limited asset market participation, focusing on the empirical observation that uncovered interest parity holds better for longer-term interest rate differentials. A quantitative exercise using Japanese and U.S. data shows that changes in term premiums, particularly those made by the central bank's bond purchases, have sizable effects on Japanese inflation rates via exchange rate dynamics.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Large technology companies such as Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Tencent have started to provide financial services. The activities of big techs in finance are a special case of broader fintech innovation. While fintech companies are set up to operate primarily in financial services, big tech firms offer financial services as part of a much wider set of activities. Big techs' foray into finance raises both opportunities and risks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it describes big techs' business models and analyses the potential benefits in their provision of financial services such as financial inclusion and reduced asymmetric information problems in the supply of credit. Second, it evaluates the potential costs, including the new risks of price discrimination, abuse of market power, anti-competitive behaviour and limits to data privacy. Third, it lays out the complex public policy trade-off between the objectives of efficiency and privacy, and discusses the policy options</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Big techs' entry in finance builds on their established digital platforms in e-commerce, search and social media, and holds the prospect of efficiency gains and greater financial inclusion. Their business model rests on enabling direct interactions among a large number of users. An essential by-product of their business is their large stock of user data, which are used as an input for a range of services that exploit natural network effects, generating further user activity. Increased user activity then completes the circle, as it generates yet more data. The self-reinforcing loop between data, network externalities and activities, is the DNA of big techs. Big techs have the potential to become dominant through the advantages afforded by the data-network-activities DNA loop – raising competition and data privacy issues.How to define and regulate the use of data has become an important policy issue for authorities and increases the need to coordinate policies at both the domestic and international level.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The business model of big techs rests on enabling direct interactions among a large number of users on digital platforms, such as in e-commerce, search and social media. An essential by-product is their large stock of user data, which they use to offer a wide range of services and exploit natural network effects, generating further user activity. Increased user activity completes the circle, as it generates yet more data. Building on the self-reinforcing nature of the data- network-activities loop, some big techs have ventured into financial services, including payments, money management, insurance and lending. The entry of big techs into finance promises efficiency gains and greater   financial inclusion. At the same time, it introduces new risks associated with market power and data privacy. The nature of the new trade-off between efficiency and privacy will depend on societal preferences, and will vary across jurisdictions. This increases the need to coordinate policies both at the domestic and international level.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p class="AuthorName" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;">The Covid-19 pandemic threatened to disrupt bank funding and market functioning. To counter this threat, prudential policymakers provided relief by temporarily loosening prudential rules. This paper investigates whether inter-agency coordination bodies for financial stability (IABs) contributed to making such prudential responses faster.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>IABs bring together policy stakeholders in a country's financial stability domain. They typically include central banks, prudential regulators and finance ministries. By sharing information, conducting joint analysis and in some cases making policy decisions, they can reduce coordination failures among member institutions. They may also serve as devices to signal that authorities which instituted them care about the issue of financial stability. However, IABs may also exacerbate policy inaction bias as they involve several authorities and may therefore mask the inaction and obscure the accountability of a single actor. This paper empirically investigates the influence of IABs on the speed of prudential relief responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the majority of IABs have soft powers that are limited to cross-agency sharing of data and analysis. More microprudential than macroprudential relief measures were enacted in response to Covid-19 and the presence of IABs has been associated with faster microprudential policy decision-making. Our findings indicate that when central banks are prudential regulators or chairs of inter-agency coordination bodies, microprudential policy responses are faster. Overall, IABs appear to have been useful catalysts for the deployment of microprudential tools for macroprudential purposes.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates whether the presence of inter-agency coordination bodies for financial stability (IABs) has been associated with faster prudential policy responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Using econometric analysis, we provide evidence that countries with IABs have enacted microprudential measures more quickly than countries without. This is not the case for macroprudential measures for which we find that IABs have been associated with slower responses. We conclude that IABs may have been useful as catalysts for the deployment of microprudential tools for macroprudential purposes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Rising debt and falling interest rates have characterised advanced economies over the past 40 years. The average real interest rate dropped from 6% in 1980 to less than zero in 2019. Meanwhile, the average debt to GDP ratio almost doubled from 139% in 1980 to over 270% in 2019. The economic fallout of the Covid-19 health crisis is likely to accelerate these patterns going forward, as governments pursue aggressive debt-financed stimulus policies. The objective of this paper is to understand how the twin phenomena of high debt and low interest rates came to be.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper explains the concomitant rise in debt and fall in interest rates by the liberalisation of the financial sector and income inequality. When rich households get richer, they tend to lend to poor ones. Given that poor households have relatively higher marginal propensities to consume, large debt levels weigh negatively on aggregate demand. As borrowers reduce their spending to make debt payments to savers, the latter – having greater saving rates – only imperfectly offset the shortfall in borrowers' spending. Such a situation, in which demand is depressed due to elevated debt levels, is called "indebted demand".</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The concept of indebted demand has broad implications for evaluating which policies can potentially help advanced economies to escape the current high-debt and low-rate environment. An important finding of the paper is that policies that boost demand today through debt accumulation necessarily reduce demand going forward by shifting resources from borrowers to savers. Therefore, such policies contribute to persistently low interest rates.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We propose a theory of indebted demand, capturing the idea that large debt burdens lower aggregate demand, and thus the natural rate of interest. At the core of the theory is the simple yet under-appreciated observation that borrowers and savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent perpetual youth model, we find that recent trends in income inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest. Moreover, popular expansionary policies-such as accommodative monetary policy-generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of high inequality.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In a low interest rate environment, financing government operations by issuing bonds is very similar to financing them by issuing bank reserves, ie money. But there remains one key difference: the way their prices are set. The price of money is the inverse of the price level. If prices are sticky, so is the price of money in terms of goods. By contrast, the price of bonds in terms of goods is free to jump all over the place. This difference matters a great deal for a number of monetary and fiscal policy issues.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We explore these issues in a bare-bones, conventional model. We assume a liquidity-in-advance constraint, so that households must have sufficient transactional liquidity (money and bonds) in their pockets in order to consume. The monetary policy regime targets the quantity of money, ie central bank reserves, and the interest rate on them, while the interest rate on the bond adjusts to clear markets. In this setting, changes in fiscal policy affect bond prices and, in turn, available liquidity, impacting aggregate demand and output.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Unanticipated fiscal expansions financed by debt issuance are neutral when permanent, but they are expansionary when transitory. In the former case, the price of bonds drops sufficiently so that total liquidity is unchanged. In the latter, bond prices fall by less than the increase in nominal supply, increasing liquidity, aggregate demand and output. Anticipated fiscal expansions, on the other hand, are recessionary. Bond prices fall faster than their supply, causing the value of government bonds outstanding to decline. The resulting liquidity squeeze causes a drop in aggregate demand and therefore output. To avoid these effects, monetary policy must stabilise bond prices by reducing the interest rate on money and expanding its supply. We conclude that in a liquidity-dependent world, fiscal and monetary policies are joined at the hip.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the effects of monetary and fiscal policies when both money and government bonds provide liquidity services. Because money is the unit of account, the price of money is the inverse of the price level. If prices are sticky, so is the price of money in terms of goods, and this is one important reason why money is liquid and attractive. By contrast, the price of government bonds is free to jump and often does, especially in response to news about changes in fiscal policy and the supply of bonds. Those movements in government bond prices affect available liquidity, and that matters for aggregate demand, inflation and output. Under these conditions, bond-financed fiscal expansions can be contractionary, causing deflation and a temporary recession. To avoid those effects, changes in bond supply must be matched by changes in money supply and in the interest rate on money. We conclude that in a liquiditydependent world, fiscal and monetary policies are joined at the hip.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In March 2020, as the Covid-19 crisis intensified, stress emerged in the market for Treasury securities. During the period 9–18 March, the 10-year yield surged sharply by 64 basis points while the stock market kept falling. This is contrary to typical risk-off events which are characterised by a simultaneous drop in equity prices and long-term yields. In response to these developments, on 15 March 2020 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) unveiled a new programme to buy large amounts of Treasuries. Purchases exceeded $1 trillion in Q1 2020. This paper seeks to provide new facts and analysis to improve understanding of the episode.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper shows that Treasury yields did not spike due to a loss of confidence in Treasury fundamentals. Once default risk, inflation and illiquidity are ruled out as central drivers of the increase in Treasury yields, the natural explanation is a negative demand shock, necessitating a fall in Treasury market prices to bring supply and demand into equilibrium. The paper studies whether Fed purchases were instrumental for reversing the yield spike and then characterises the negative demand shock. It documents unusually large sales of Treasury securities by certain investor groups and investigates the drivers of such selling, providing novel insights and empirical support.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The yield spike was driven by urgent liquidity needs of mutual funds, foreign official agencies and hedge funds. These needs were unchanged by the Fed's announcement on 15 March 2020 necessitating large actual purchases to reverse the yield spike. The paper finds that Fed Treasury securities purchases were causal in reducing Treasury yields on the basis of: (1) the timing of purchases (which increased on 19 March); (2) evidence against confounding factors; and (3) the timing of yield reversal and Fed purchases in the mortgage-backed securities market. The large impact of yields at the time of purchase contrasts with prior quantitative easing (QE) programmes and suggests a shortage of arbitrage capital.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Treasury yields spiked during the initial phase of COVID. The 10-year yield increased by 64 bps from March 9 to 18, 2020, leading the Federal Reserve to purchase $1T of Treasuries in 2020Q1. Fed Treasury purchases were causal for reducing Treasury yields based on (1) the timing of purchases (which increased on March 19), (2) evidence against confounding factors, and (3) the timing of yield reversal and Fed purchases in the MBS market. Treasury-QE worked more via purchases than announcements. The yield spike was driven by liquidity needs of mutual funds, foreign official agencies, and hedge funds that were unaffected by the March 15, 2020 Treasury-QE announcement.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Businesses have confronted unprecedented challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic. Restrictions on people's movements have not only led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity, but also forced firms to alter their business models. Selling goods online has become the new norm, and so too has remote work. This paper analyses the extent to which better digital and technological infrastructure has helped firms to withstand the Covid-19 recession and adapt to this new environment.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Recent papers highlight the impact of rules about working from home, managerial practices and the role of technology more generally on firm performance during Covid-19. And yet, empirical evidence on the role of a country's digital capabilities to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on businesses is scarce.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Based on a large sample of firms in 17 countries, this paper shows that businesses headquartered in countries with better digital capabilities – as measured by their position in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking – had higher revenues during the pandemic relative to their pre-pandemic trend. This effect is especially pronounced among smaller firms, suggesting that technological capacity may have mitigated the adverse effects of the pandemic on relatively small firms.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Can higher technological capacity help firms to recover quicker from recessions? Analyzing the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on firm revenues in several countries, we find that firms headquartered in jurisdictions with better digital infrastructure generated relatively higher revenue during the shock period. Improving a country's technological capability by one standard deviation is associated with a relative increase in revenues of the average firm by around 4%. The positive effect of technology is more pronounced among smaller firms, suggesting that it could have helped the recovery of SMEs.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the performance of a range of macroeconomic policy tools under a managed float in a simple open economy with financial frictions. These tools include monetary policy, fiscal policy, foreign exchange intervention, macroprudential policy and capital controls. The impact of these policies are studied individually to highlight their transmission channels. However, we also study their impact in pairs in response to capital inflows induced by a reduction in world interest rates. This highlights the extent to which they complement each other.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Some of the issues which we study have been addressed in relatively complex quantitative models. However, simple analytical policy tools which emphasise the role of financial frictions – a key feature of modern macroeconomics – are still missing. Our model is analytically tractable and can be used to study the impact of these policies. It therefore provides a useful entry point to the more advanced literature.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that whether monetary policy should be contractionary or expansionary, to stabilise the economy in response to capital inflows driven by external financial shocks, depends on which other instrument(s) policymakers have at their disposal. In particular, if fiscal policy is the only other instrument available, a reduction in the policy interest rate and a spending cut is effective. However, if the other available instrument is capital controls, an increase in the policy rate coupled with a tightening of capital controls is most effective to stabilise the economy. The fact that an effective policy mix may involve higher rather than lower interest rates, depending on the other instrument available, runs counter to standard policy prescriptions.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper presents a simple integrated macroeconomic model of a small, bank-dependent open economy with a managed float and financial frictions. The model is used to study, both analytically and diagrammatically, the macroeconomic effects of five types of policy instruments: fiscal policy, monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, foreign exchange intervention, and capital controls, in the form of a tax on bank foreign borrowing. We also consider a drop in the world interest rate and examine how these instruments can be adjusted jointly to restore the initial equilibrium. Although this analysis is only partial (given, in particular, the static nature of the model and the absence of an explicit account of policy preferences), it provides new insights on how macroeconomic policies operate under a managed float and financial frictions, and how these policies can complement each other in response to capital inflows driven by "push" factors. In particular, the analysis shows that, to stabilize the economy, whether monetary policy should be contractionary or expansionary depends on which other instruments are available to policymakers. The joint use of macroprudential regulation and capital controls is also shown to provide a potent combination to manage capital inflows.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We evaluate the efficacy of the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), a programme implemented by the Fed to stabilise the US corporate bond market in the wake of the Covid-19 shock. The Fed announced the SMCCF on 23 March 2020 and expanded the programme on 9 April. We estimate the direct effects of the Fed's announcements on corporate bond prices and market liquidity measures using a matched sample of programme-eligible and ineligible securities. We also identify the Fed's actual purchases in the secondary market, which allows us to quantify the impact of the facility's purchases on credit and bid-ask spreads.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study the impact of the Fed's announcements and the impact of its actual purchases, highlighting the power of promises made by modern central banks when markets have trust that the central bank is able to deliver on its promises. We show that in circumstances where there is trust, the central bank needs to do less to deliver on its promises.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the two announcements significantly reduced credit and bid-ask spreads and that this appears to have had little to do with whether or not a particular bond was eligible for purchase by the SMCCF. The narrowing of credit spreads was due almost entirely to a reduction in credit risk premia, as opposed to a reduction in default risk. The Fed's forceful response to pandemic-induced turmoil in financial markets shored up investor confidence and improved market sentiment, effectively forestalling fire sales and stabilising conditions in the market well before the Fed bought anything. In fact, our results indicate that the Fed's actual purchases of individual corporate bonds had negligible effects on credit and bid-ask spreads.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We evaluate the efficacy of the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), a program designed to stabilize the U.S. corporate bond market during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fed announced the SMCCF on March 23, 2020, and expanded the program on April 9. Our results show that the two announcements significantly lowered credit and bid-ask spreads, the former almost entirely through a reduction in credit risk premia. The announcements had a differential effect on the program-eligible bonds relative to their ineligible counterparts, but this difference is not due to program eligibility per se, according to our results. Rather, the announcements restored the "normal" upward-sloping profile of the term structure of credit spreads by substantially reducing spreads at the short end of the maturity spectrum relative to spreads at the long end. Using an IV approach, we also document important announcement-induced spillovers across all bonds outstanding for issuers whose bonds were likely to be purchased by the facility. Finally, we show that the Fed's actual purchases had negligible effects on credit and bid ask spreads. Our results highlight the extraordinary power of modern central banks: when markets have trust in the central bank's ability to deliver on its promise, as exemplified by the iconic "whatever it takes" remark by Mario Draghi, the central bank needs to do less (if anything) to deliver on its promise.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>There are two main reasons for cross-border regulatory coordination. Firstly, there is the regulatory "race to the bottom". This is a tendency to remove regulation in order to give domestic banks a competitive advantage. Secondly, there is the issue of "leakages". Banks can bypass domestic regulations by setting-up subsidiaries in places with laxer standards. This paper proposes a different mechanism in support of cross-border regulatory coordination. It focuses on the interplay between regulatory policies and global lending conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Lending conditions in emerging market economies (the periphery) are greatly impacted by external factors, including what happens in core economies. As a result, such lending conditions do not necessarily accord with the needs of the periphery. This can lead to an inefficient allocation of credit.</p>
<p>Regulatory policy can help to regain some control over lending conditions for the periphery. In practice, this means imposing controls on capital flows, or imposing additional regulation on bank funding. However, such unilateral actions affect the core. The core responds by tightening its own policies. This partly offsets the benefits for the periphery. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Policymakers can achieve better outcomes by setting regulatory policies cooperatively. They understand that tightening domestic regulations imposes costs beyond their borders. As a result, with cooperation, cross-border lending is higher, and lending conditions are closer to those that accord with the needs of the periphery.</p>
<p>The median cooperation gain is slightly above 1% at the global level. However, it is not symmetrical. It is about 0 in the core, but around 2% for the periphery. Moreover, although coordinating lending conditions yields larger gains than coordinating regulatory policies, only gains resulting from the coordination of regulatory policies are positive for both regions.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using a model of strategic interactions between two countries, I investigate the gains to international coordination of financial regulation policies, and how these gains depend on global lending conditions. When global lending conditions are determined non-cooperatively, I show that coordinating regulatory policies leads to a Pareto improvement relative to the case of no cooperation. In the non-cooperative equilibrium, one region - the core - determines global lending conditions, leaving the other region - the periphery - in a sub-optimal situation. The periphery then tightens regulatory policy to reduce the cost of sub-optimal lending conditions. Yet, in doing so, it fails to internalise a cross-border externality: tightening regulatory policy in one region limits ex ante borrowing in the other region, which increases the cost of sub-optimal lending conditions for the periphery. The equilibrium with cooperative regulatory policies can then improve on this outcome as both regions take into account the cross-border externality and allow for larger ex ante borrowing, ending in a lower cost of suboptimal lending conditions for the periphery.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Private equity (PE) firms strongly affect the activities of companies which they acquire. After buyouts, target companies enjoy better access to finance and experience operational enhancements. Such improvements could help companies acquired by PE firms to increase their export activities. Ascertaining whether this is the case is important because reaching external markets brings many benefits both to corporates and to the economy as a whole.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We examine whether PE firms enhance targets' exports after acquisition by using a panel data set of UK companies for the period 2004–2017. To identify the impact, we use difference-in-differences estimations comparing target companies to similar companies which were not acquired by PE firms. In addition, we examine if the effect of PE firms on target exports is greater when target companies had previously had credit constraints. Further, we assess whether the impact of PE firms on target company exports relates to the easing of financial constraints and/or enhancements in productivity. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Following PE buyouts, targets are likely to increase their exports relative to other, similar companies. Indeed, we find that non-exporting targets may start exporting. In addition, targets of PE buyouts exhibit higher export volumes and higher exporting intensity after being acquired relative to other, similar companies. These effects are stronger when the targets had been financially constrained or had exhibited lower productivity. These findings suggest that private equity investors boost target companies' exports by mitigating financing constraints and boosting productivity.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper examines the impact of private equity buyouts on the export activity of target firms. We exploit data on UK firms over the 2004-2017 period, and use difference-in-differences estimations on matched target versus non-target firms. Following private equity buyouts, non-exporting firms are more likely to begin exporting, and target firms are likewise more likely to increase their value of exports and their export intensity. Evidence from split-sample analysis further suggests that these patterns are consistent with private equity investors relaxing financial constraints and inducing productivity improvements.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Are banks window dressing their balance sheets to avoid tougher regulation? We explore this question by studying the assessment of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). We examine the evolution of the G-SIB "score" around supervisory reporting dates for a large sample of banks in the European Union (EU). The score is the regulatory measure that determines banks' G-SIB status and the attendant capital requirements. It predominantly relies on a snapshot of banks' balance sheets at year-end.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We illustrate how banks in the EU compress their G-SIB score at year-end. We approximate the score at quarterly frequency based on supervisory data and establish that G-SIBs' year-end adjustments differ markedly from those of other banks. Moreover, we highlight that these adjustments distort the supervisory assessment of banks' systemic importance. While a variety of factors may be driving banks' window dressing, we show that the tightness of capital requirements plays an important role and shed light on how the G-SIB rules interact with other regulatory requirements, such as national capital surcharges. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our analysis uncovers a large and systematic contraction in the score of EU G-SIBs at year-end. We show that several G-SIBs repeatedly lower their scores to an extent that they reduce their capital requirements. Moreover, a few banks appear to have avoided G-SIB designation altogether in some years. G-SIBs reduce their score in several ways, for instance by temporarily cutting back on intra-financial sector linkages and derivatives positions. G-SIBs with stronger capital ratios and those subject to higher national capital surcharges window dress less than other G-SIBs, which underscores the importance of regulation in banks' balance sheet decisions. Overall, our findings argue in favour of moving away from using point-in-time data in regulatory requirements and making greater use of averages. They also highlight the importance of supervisory judgment in the assessment of G-SIBs. This could help address banks' window dressing and mitigate any associated adverse impact on financial markets.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study banks' year-end window dressing in the European Union to assess how it affects the identification of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and the associated capital surcharges. We find that G-SIBs compress their balance sheet at year-end to an extent that they can reduce their surcharges or avoid G-SIB designation altogether. G-SIBs use several levers to adjust their balance sheets. Most notably, they compress intra-financial system assets and liabilities as well as their derivative books at year-end. Moreover, G-SIBs that are more tightly constrained by capital requirements window dress more than their peers. Our findings underscore the importance of supervisory judgement in the assessment of G-SIBs and call for greater use of average as opposed to point-in-time data to measure banks' systemic importance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The global economy has rebounded strongly from the trough last year, as vaccination paved the way for lifting restrictions. Yet the recovery is uneven and global outlook remains uncertain. Many countries face vaccine shortages, and new virus strains threaten to derail progress made. To prepare for challenges lying ahead, it will be important to draw on experiences to date.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper evaluates output losses resulting from the pandemic from historical and cross-country perspectives. It discusses challenges in managing the pandemic, notably in balancing health and economic goals. It draws some key lessons, as informed by the literature and model estimates. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Estimates suggest a median output loss of about 6.5% in 2020. This should narrow to around 4% of the pre-pandemic trend by the end of 2021. Losses are highly dispersed across economies due to varying economic structures and societies' responses. Economic impact of various pandemic scenarios can be quantified using an economic-epidemiological model.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This article provides an interim assessment of the macroeconomic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Estimates suggest a median output loss of about 6.5% in 2020, a gap that is expected to narrow to around 4% of the pre-pandemic trend by the end of 2021. There is however a high dispersion of economic losses across economies, reflecting varying exposures to the pandemic and societies' responses. High-frequency indicators and epidemiological models provide some insights into the interactions between the evolution of the pandemic and societies' strategies for combating it, including the role of vaccination. The article draws lessons from experiences thus far and discusses challenges ahead.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>International sharing of aggregate risk improves social welfare by allowing a smooth adjustment to shocks. The case for cross-border insurance remains strong even when crises are global in nature. Countries have largely different exposure to global crises - the Great Financial Crisis in 2008 and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic have largely asymmetric effects across borders.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We provide a new angle on the gains from sharing output volatility and tail risk, ie the risk of a deep downturn. We show that riskier countries primarily gain in terms of smoothing; safer countries primarily gain by the macroeconomic analogue of "selling insurance". Intuitively, safer countries achieve a higher average level of consumption through higher prices of their assets and improved terms of trade. Efficient risk-sharing thus entails implicit transfers of wealth from riskier to safer countries. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We quantify the size and sources of the relative gains from risk-sharing for 156 countries. Our model predicts significant relative gains for both risky and safe countries. Tail risk enhances the relative gains for the latter. Relative to a safer country, the gain of a riskier country in the 95th percentile of the gains' distribution amounts to about 10% of global welfare gains.</p>
<p>These results have policy implications. First, they clarify how safer countries benefit from efficient financial integration and risk-sharing with countries displaying pronounced volatility and more exposed to crises and tail events (disasters). Second, they underscore the need for comprehensive indicators of aggregate insurance, beyond the reliance on consumption growth volatility and cross-border correlation.</p>
<p>Our paper warns about the potential welfare losses from financial protectionism and isolation. Identifying and correcting market imperfections that could reduce the benefits of financial integration should remain a necessary precondition for reaping the full benefits of international risk-sharing.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Crises and tail events have asymmetric effects across borders, raising the value of arrangements improving insurance of macroeconomic risk. Using a two-country DSGE model, we provide an analytical and quantitative analysis of the channels through which countries gain from sharing (tail) risk. Riskier countries gain in smoother consumption but lose in relative wealth and average consumption. Safer countries benefit from higher wealth and better average terms of trade. Calibrated using the empirical distribution of moments of GDP-growth across countries, the model suggests significant quantitative effects. We offer an algorithm for the correct solution of the equilibrium using DSGE models under complete markets, at higher order of approximation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When a firm cannot easily substitute financially constrained clients or suppliers in the face of an adverse monetary policy shock, the fall in demand or supply may create bottlenecks and induce the firm to cut back its activity. We refer to this as the "ripple effects" of monetary policy. This paper studies how conventional monetary policy transmits through the demand and supply of intermediate goods and the role of input-output linkages as transmission channels.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use detailed information on existing firm supply chains to investigate the ripple effects of monetary policy. We study the demand channel by analysing how firms' sales react to changes in monetary conditions as a function of their clients' financial health. We also study the cost channel by analysing the reaction of firms' purchases to changes in monetary conditions as a function of their suppliers' financial health. What is new in our approach is that we allow for monetary policy to work through the balance sheets of the firms' clients and suppliers, as well as through the firms themselves. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our main findings are twofold. Firstly, the balance sheet structure of downstream and upstream firms is a salient, yet mostly overlooked, element in the transmission of monetary policy. Secondly, changes in monetary conditions have a quantitatively larger impact on firms' operations through the changes in demand induced by clients' financial health, than through the firms' own balance sheets.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Is conventional monetary policy transmitted through the demand for and supply of intermediate goods in an economy? Analyzing unique US data on corporate linkages, we document that downstream and upstream corporate financial health are instrumental for the transmission of monetary policy. Our estimates suggest that contractionary changes in monetary conditions lead to reductions in both the demand and the supply of all financially constrained business partners, thereby creating bottlenecks, which induce the linked firms themselves to curtail their own activities ("ripple effects"). Overall, our estimates suggest that changes in monetary conditions may have a quantitatively larger impact on firms' operations through the changes in demand and supply induced by constrained business partners than through the firms' own financial conditions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>An important channel of monetary policy transmission operates through agents' expectations about inflation. Central banks' communication strategies aim to steer agents' expectations consistently with the monetary policy decisions taken. It is generally acknowledged that financial markets participants' expectations react promptly to monetary policy announcements. But how well do such strategies perform in shaping expectations of households, especially those less sensitive to economic news?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study the impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcements on households' expectations by comparing responses to the Survey of Consumer Expectations before and after Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, over the period 2013-19. Contrary to studies based on experimental evidence where households are provided with information on the outcome of the FOMC meeting, our approach assesses households' reaction to the Fed announcements or to the information filtered by the media.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that monetary policy announcements affect expectations of interest rates on savings accounts, particularly for respondents with high financial literacy. But the impact of monetary policy announcements on inflation expectations is muted, even in response to some of the most relevant FOMC meetings that took place during that period. Our results stand in contrast to experimental studies documenting stronger effects of monetary policy announcements on households' expectations. This suggests that the flow of information on monetary policy that naturally reaches the general population may provide too weak signals.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We use stock exchange message data to quantify the negative aspect of high-frequency trading, known as "latency arbitrage". This means arbitrage opportunities that are sufficiently mechanical and obvious that capturing them is primarily a contest in speed.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper makes three main contributions to the literature. The first is methodological: we utilise the entirety of exchange message data, as opposed to standard order book data, to measure latency arbitrage. The second is the set of empirical facts we document about latency arbitrage. The third contribution is that we develop two new approaches to quantifying latency arbitrage as a proportion of the overall cost of liquidity.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that races are very frequent and very fast, and that over 20% of trading volume takes place in races. A small number of firms win the large majority of races, disproportionately as takers of liquidity. Most races are for very small amounts of money, averaging just over half a tick. But even just half a tick, over 20% of trading volume, adds up. The latency arbitrage tax, defined as latency arbitrage profits divided by trading volume, is 0.42 basis points. This amounts to about GBP 60 million annually in the UK. Extrapolating from our UK data, our estimates imply that latency arbitrage is worth about $5 billion annually in global equity markets alone.</p>
<p>The new approaches we develop to quantify latency arbitrage as a proportion of the overall cost of liquidity, used in conjunction with our results, show that latency arbitrage accounts for 33% of the effective spread and 31% of all price impact, and that market designs that eliminate latency arbitrage would reduce the cost of liquidity for investors by 17%.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use stock exchange message data to quantify the negative aspect of high-frequency trading, known as "latency arbitrage". The key difference between message data and widely familiar limit order book data is that message data contain attempts to trade or cancel that fail. This allows the researcher to observe both winners and losers in a race, whereas in limit order book data you cannot see the losers, so you cannot directly see the races. We find that latency arbitrage races are very frequent (about one per minute per symbol for FTSE 100 stocks), extremely fast (the modal race lasts 5-10 millionths of a second), and account for a remarkably large portion of overall trading volume (about 20%). Race participation is concentrated, with the top six firms accounting for over 80% of all race wins and losses. The average race is worth just a small amount (about half a price tick), but because of the large volumes the stakes add up. Our main estimates suggest that races constitute roughly one third of price impact and the effective spread (key microstructure measures of the cost of liquidity), that latency arbitrage imposes a roughly 0.5 basis point tax on trading, that market designs that eliminate latency arbitrage would reduce the market's cost of liquidity by 17%, and that the total sums at stake are on the order of $5 billion per year in global equity markets alone.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><strong>﻿</strong>Equilibrium real interest rates have declined significantly over recent decades. As a consequence, the zero lower bound (ZLB) on policy rates has become a more binding constraint for conventional monetary policy. This paper analyses the implications of the ZLB under low equilibrium interest rates for macroeconomic and public debt stability. It zooms in on the role of quantitative easing (QE) as a monetary policy instrument and on the interaction between fiscal rules and monetary policy in a low interest rate world.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a small-scale model of the economy with the aim of studying fiscal-monetary interactions at the ZLB. The model extends previous analysis of robust interest rate policy to account for QE policies, fiscal policy and government debt dynamics. It acknowledges imperfect knowledge of the structure of the economy by incorporating expectations formation based on perpetual learning. The model is used to simulate the implications of the ZLB, QE policy and fiscal rules for macroeconomic and public debt dynamics.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, we find that a low equilibrium rate of interest gives rise to a frequently binding ZLB constraint and worse macroeconomic outcomes. Fiscal policy has to intervene more aggressively to compensate for less potent monetary policy, leading to higher and more volatile public debt. Second, the systematic use of countercyclical QE by the central bank can mitigate the ZLB constraint, yielding more stable inflation, unemployment and public debt. Third, debt-averse fiscal policy harms economic stability, while a more aggressive countercyclical fiscal policy at the ZLB in combination with QE policy can enhance it. Fourth, combining moderately negative policy rates with QE appears to improve economic stability. Finally, a credible inflation goal anchoring long-run inflation expectations can mitigate the stabilisation costs associated with the ZLB and reduce the need for aggressive QE.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We analyse fiscal and monetary policy interactions when interest rate policy is hampered by the zero lower bound (ZLB) in an environment where expectations are formed with perpetual learning. The ZLB induces a deterioration of economic performance and raises the risk of persistent low ation that can disanchor in ation expectations and lead to debt de ation. Systematic use of quantitative easing (QE) can partially substitute for interest rate easing and, if sufficiently aggressive, can maintain average in ation in line with the central bank's goal. By compressing term premia on longterm interest rates, QE creates fiscal space that facilitates expansionary fiscal policy and reduces debt-de ation risk. The ZLB can be counteracted with less aggressive QE if mildly negative policy rates are feasible, if more countercyclical fiscal policy can be activated, or if the central bank can credibly communicate a clear in ation goal. Timidity in implementing QE and excessively debt-averse fiscal policies are counterproductive.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How should supervisory risk assessments, such as stress tests, inform bank regulation when such assessments provide imprecise signals? What trade-offs do regulators face when redesigning assessments to improve accuracy? Does the disclosure of assessment results improve the effectiveness of capital requirements? We develop a theoretical framework to investigate these questions. A key element of our framework is the impact of assessment accuracy on the future behaviour of banks. This, in turn, is crucial for the design of risk assessments and for subsequent decision-making about capital requirements.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper strives to fill an apparent gap in the literature. Despite empirical evidence of noisy risk assessments, there is a lack of studies on what this noise implies for the effectiveness of capital requirements. We examine how capital regulation based on potentially inaccurate assessments affects banks' incentives to improve their risk profile, and derive the attendant optimal regulation. Our framework is robust and tractable. This also allows us to study trade-offs faced by regulators when making assessments more accurate and in disclosing results to investors. Moreover, we examine trade-offs involved in choosing optimal capital requirements when bank failure is socially costly.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that higher capital requirements can create adverse incentives. This can lead to more risky banks when information frictions are present. As such, capital requirements must be less sensitive to assessment results when accuracy is lower. Where the regulator can enhance some aspects of accuracy only by worsening others, it may be optimal to impose lower capital requirements. We find that while disclosure of assessment outcomes can improve market discipline in general, when assessments are less accurate they can amplify risk-taking by banks. This further limits the effectiveness of capital requirements based on assessments. Regulatory trade-offs are aggravated when bank failures are more costly.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Supervisory risk assessment tools, such as stress-tests, provide complementary information about bank-specific risk exposures. Recent empirical evidence, however, underscores the potential inaccuracies inherent in such assessments. We develop a model to investigate the regulatory implications of these inaccuracies. In the absence of such tools, the regulator sets the same requirement across banks. Risk assessment tools provide a noisy signal about banks' types, and enable bank specific capital surcharges, which can improve welfare. Yet, a noisy assessment can distort banks' ex ante incentives and lead to riskier banks. The optimal surcharge is zero when assessment accuracy is below a certain threshold, and increases with accuracy otherwise.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the size and source of exchange-traded funds' (ETFs) price impact in the most ETF-dominated asset classes: volatility (VIX) and commodities. These ETFs hold a much larger share of the underlying market compared with equities or bonds. The fraction of ETFs in the market for VIX futures often exceeds 40%, whereas it is less than 2% in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Several episodes from the VIX market in 2018 and the oil market in 2020 showed that large ETF-induced trading can exacerbate price changes in turbulent times. To understand the risks of trading against ETFs, I propose a novel decomposition of ETF demand into three major components: calendar rebalancing, flow rebalancing and leverage rebalancing.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The existing ETF literature has focused almost exclusively on equity markets, where fundamental values are difficult to measure. I use the beneficial setting of the futures market, where non-fundamental price distortions are easier to quantify. Without making any assumptions, I directly test whether the ETF-influenced futures price is informative about the fundamental cash flow (spot price) at expiration. The institutional features of VIX and commodity ETFs allow me also to study the price impact of leverage-induced trading.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, ETFs put pressure on the prices of underlying assets in VIX and commodity markets. Second, ETF price impact is not related to price discovery but manifests itself through an increase in the non-fundamental part of prices. To identify ETF-induced price distortions, I propose a model-independent approach for replicating the fundamental value of a VIX futures contract. I use the definition of variance and construct a synthetic futures contract that is not influenced by ETFs. This allows me to isolate a non-fundamental price gap of 0.61 volatility points (113% of the first-month futures basis). A simple strategy of trading VIX futures based on the sign of the EFG delivers a Sharpe ratio of 1.78. Third, leverage rebalancing has the largest impact on non-fundamental price deviations. This type of ETF demand amplifies price changes and introduces unhedgeable risks for ETF counterparties, exposing them negatively to variance.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies exchange-traded funds' (ETFs) price impact in the most ETF dominated asset classes: volatility (VIX) and commodities. I propose a model-independent approach to replicate the VIX futures contract. This allows me to isolate a non-fundamental component in VIX futures prices that is strongly related to the rebalancing of ETFs. To understand the source of that component, I decompose trading demand from ETFs into three parts: leverage rebalancing, calendar rebalancing, and flow rebalancing. Leverage rebalancing has the largest effects. It amplifies price changes and exposes ETF counterparties negatively to variance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether have been marketed as alternatives to government-issued currencies and commercial banking. Proponents argue that key value propositions of the asset class are their asserted resistance to debasement and censorship by governments or financial institutions over who can transact. We evaluate whether distrust in the existing financial system is indeed a motive for investing in cryptocurrencies. We also examine the socioeconomic characteristics of cryptocurrency holders.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper uses US survey data to consider whether cryptocurrencies are attractive to retail investors as alternatives to the mainstream financial system. We also provide a profile of investors and discuss their level of knowledge about this asset class. We then analyse patterns of cryptocurrency investment over time and across different cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find no evidence to support the hypothesis that cryptocurrencies are sought as alternatives to the mainstream financial system. Investors in cryptocurrencies show no more concern about the security of cash or commercial banking than the rest of the population. Cryptocurrency investors tend to be educated, young and male. People who have experience using digital finance are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies. In recent years a gap in ownership of cryptocurrencies across genders has emerged despite converging knowledge levels about cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p> We examine how investor characteristics vary across different cryptocurrencies. We find that owners of cryptocurrencies tend to stick with their investments.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Employing representative data from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, we disprove the hypothesis that cryptocurrency investors are motivatedby distrust in fiat currencies or regulated finance. Compared with the general population, investors show no differences in their level of security concerns with either cash or commercial banking services. We find that cryptocurrency investors tend to be educated, young and digital natives. In recent years, a gap in ownership of cryptocurrencies across genders has emerged. We examine how investor characteristics vary across cryptocurrencies and show that owners of cryptocurrencies increasingly tend to hold their investment for longer periods.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study how the exchange rate's response to monetary and fiscal policy depends on the fiscal regime. In a Ricardian regime, the government always backs its debt, ie commits to increasing taxes in the future to satisfy its intertemporal budget constraint. In a non-Ricardian regime, the government does not necessarily commit to finance its debt. In this case, the fiscal authority may eventually default or the central bank may accommodate fiscal deficits, creating money and inflating away the debt.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use the daily forecasts of the primary balance and the monetary policy rate around policy announcements to construct a time series of fiscal and monetary policy surprises. We look at daily movements of the Brazilian real around policy announcements and test whether its reaction is different during periods of fiscal distress. We develop a small open economy model of sovereign default in which the fiscal regime switches between Ricardian and non-Ricardian, and sovereign risk drives the currency excess return.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In normal times, an increase in the Brazilian policy rate or in government spending leads to an appreciation of the real. During periods of fiscal distress, when market participants' concern about debt sustainability rises, the real depreciates. The model replicates these findings. A higher interest rate or fiscal deficit leads to an appreciation of the currency when the fiscal regime is Ricardian. When the regime is non-Ricardian, the associated increase in debt raises sovereign risk and the currency excess return, depreciating the exchange rate. The unconventional behaviour of the exchange rate in the non-Ricardian regime persists if the central bank accommodates the fiscal deficit through higher inflation.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper, we argue that the effect of monetary and fiscal policies on the exchange rate depends on the fiscal regime. A contractionary monetary (expansionary fiscal) shock can lead to a depreciation, rather than an appreciation, of the domestic currency if debt is not backed by future fiscal surpluses. We look at daily movements of the Brazilian real around policy announcements and find strong support for the existence of two regimes with opposite signs. The unconventional response of the exchange rate occurs when fiscal fundamentals are deteriorating and markets' concern about debt sustainability is rising. To rationalize these findings, we propose a model of sovereign default in which foreign investors are subject to higher haircuts and fiscal policy shifts between Ricardian and non-Ricardian regimes. In the latter, sovereign default risk drives the currency risk premium and affects how the exchange rate reacts to policy shocks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The ongoing development of China's financial system and its increased influence on global economic and financial conditions creates a need for tools to evaluate the stance of monetary policy in China. Key among these is an estimate of the natural interest rate – the real policy interest rate that would be consistent with a closed output gap and stable inflation over the medium run – in China. Previous attempts to estimate the natural interest rate have struggled to overcome the challenges posed by relatively short macroeconomic data samples and stable aggregate GDP growth statistics.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a method to estimate the natural interest rate for China. The key to our approach is to use multiple sources of information to form inferences about key unobserved variables, like the output gap and trend inflation. With these quantities in hand, we are able to identify the role of monetary policy in shaping macroeconomic outcomes in China and generate plausible estimates of the natural interest rate.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the natural interest rate in China is currently around 2–3%. It was previously higher – at around 3–5% – between the late 1990s and 2010, before declining over the past decade. Real policy interest rates have generally tracked the natural interest rate closely, consistent with China's economy having a relatively small output gap for much of this time. Around two thirds of the decline in the natural interest rate in China reflects a decline in the rate of trend growth. The decline in the natural interest rate in China mirrors that in other economies.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We estimate the natural interest rate in China. The natural interest rate averaged between 3 and 5 per cent between the late 1990s and 2010, but declined over the next decade to around 2 per cent. We attribute around two-thirds of the decline in China's natural interest rate to a lower rate of potential output growth. As the decline in the natural interest rate in China mirrors that observed in many other economies, it is possible that global factors explain part of the decline in the natural rate not explained by lower growth.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Almost 50 central banks have already launched designs for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or prototypes. We ask what the rationale for issuing a CBDC is and how these objectives shape its economic design, as well as the architecture of the underlying technical systems.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper discusses the range of proposed CBDC architectures, how they could complement existing payment options, and what they imply for the financial system and the central bank of the future. It sets out the requirements for a "minimally invasive" CBDC design – one that upgrades money to current needs without disrupting the proven two-tier architecture of the monetary system, which involves both the private and public sectors. We start by revisiting the unique role of cash in today's financial system and what it implies for the economic, operational and technological requirements that will underpin a retail CBDC.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that technological developments inspired by popular cryptocurrency systems – based on anonymity and lacking a central authority – do not meet the requirements for a retail CBDC.</p>
<p>Instead, digital banknotes that run on "intermediated" or "hybrid" CBDC architectures show promise. Supported with technology to facilitate record-keeping by private sector entities of direct claims on the central bank, their economic design should emphasise the use of the CBDC as medium of exchange. At the same time, it will need to limit its appeal as a savings vehicle.</p>
<p>A range of different operational arrangements is possible. In hybrid designs, the central bank hosts a database of retail balances (even if anonymised), whereas in intermediated designs, it would keep track only of wholesale balances. Within this design space, a novel trade-off emerges for central banks: they can operate either a complex technical infrastructure or a complex supervisory regime.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>CBDCs should let central banks provide a universal means of payment for the digital era. At the same time, such currencies must safeguard consumer privacy and maintain the two-tier financial system. We set out the economic and operational requirements for a "minimally invasive" design – one that preserves the private sector's primary role in retail payments and financial intermediation – for CBDCs and discuss the implications for the underlying technology. Developments inspired by popular cryptocurrency systems do not meet these requirements. Instead, cash is the model for CBDC design. Showing particular promise are digital banknotes that run on "intermediated" or "hybrid" CBDC architectures, supported with technology to facilitate record-keeping of direct claims on the central bank by private  sector entities. Their economic design should emphasise the use of the CBDC as medium of exchange but needs to limit its appeal as a savings vehicle. In the process, a novel trade-off for central banks emerges: they can operate either a complex technical infrastructure or a complex supervisory regime. There are many ways to proceed, but all require central banks to develop substantial technological expertise.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Technology companies entering the financial services industry have become a global phenomenon over the past decade. Using the rise of two big techs in China as a foundation for analysis, this paper examines the key factors that have driven the development in China and whether such factors are applicable elsewhere.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper takes a historical approach in examining favourable factors that contributed to the strong growth of big techs in China, and how regulators struck a balance between nurturing financial innovations and keeping emerging stability risks at bay.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The fight for survival was the key motivation driving the initial expansion to the financial services industry. As economic theory predicts, big techs running network products need a large user base to survive against competition. Providing financial services is an important means to achieve that objective. Accordingly, they can be viewed as "accidental financiers" rather than "aggressive invaders", at least during the initial stage.</p>
<p>Several China-specific factors have played an important role in fostering the rapid growth, including its large population, the availability of low-cost mobile handsets in the country and heavy investment by the government on mobile communication infrastructure. These factors may not be easily replicated elsewhere.  </p>
<p>A balanced-regulatory approach is important. Development in China highlights the importance of striking a balance between regulatory tolerance during the early stage and tough regulations where signs of excessive growth are evident. While traditional activity-based regulations can still serve regulators well in many areas, regulators also need to closely monitor product innovations to rein in fast-emerging risks, including those involving new regulation. In particular, it is natural to see big techs introducing new products to exploit grey areas of existing regulation or other untested premises.</p>
<p>Finally, the prospect of big techs becoming heavily involved in cross-border transfers/payments would require special attention and coordination among home/host central banks.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Technology companies entering the financial services industry have become a global phenomenon over the past decade. This trend is most remarkable in China where two large technology firms (BigTechs) have emerged as important market players, especially in payment services. This paper examines the factors driving this development and whether the Chinese experience could be applied elsewhere. Several lessons emerge: first, like any company in a network industry, it is important to build and maintain a large user base and that is the key factor behind BigTechs' expansion into the financial industry. On this basis, these BigTechs can be seen as "accidental financiers" rather than "aggressive invaders". Second, these firms are cautious in offering higher-risk financial services as investment losses could lead to an exodus of customers. Third, Chinese authorities' regulatory tolerance during the early stage has been a key supporting factor and helped fostering innovation benefits. But that was balanced by the implementation of capital and liquidity rules to keep BigTechs from "excessive" growth, mis-selling of financial products and posing systemic risks. Fourth, initial conditions and government support matter. The rapid growth has benefitted from China's large population, the availability of low-cost mobile handsets and heavy investment by the government on mobile communication infrastructure. These may not be easily be replicated elsewhere. Last, BigTechs' overseas expansion may require policy coordination between home and host authorities to keep track of emerging risks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Do banks price the risks of climate policy change? We combine syndicated loan data with carbon intensity data (CO2 emissions relative to revenue) of borrowers across a wide range of industries. With this data, we study whether banks charge a "carbon premium". Firms with higher carbon intensity are at risk to suffer penalties if stricter climate policies, such as carbon taxes, are introduced. Hence, banks should be charging higher rates for firms with a higher carbon intensity.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The pricing of "stranded assets" in the fossil fuel industry has received early attention in the literature. We argue that carbon risks go beyond stranded assets and apply to firms in all industries with a carbon footprint. We analyse emissions directly attributable to the firm (scope 1), those more broadly measured to include indirect emissions from consumed energy (scopes 2), as well as those including emissions from production inputs ("upstream" scope 3).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that carbon risks in the syndicated loan market are priced consistently both across and within industry sectors – after the Paris Agreement. Our results suggest that banks have started to internalise possible risks from the transition to a low-carbon economy – but only for the risks captured by the narrowly defined scope 1 carbon emissions. The overall carbon footprint of firms (including scopes 2 and 3) has not been priced. Further, the price of risk we find for scope 1 emissions is low relative to the expected financial hit to firm revenues from an introduction of carbon prices at plausible levels. Neither do banks that signal they are green nor do de facto green banks appear to charge a higher carbon premium.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Do banks price the risks of climate policy change? Combining syndicated loan data with carbon intensity data (CO2 emissions relative to revenue) of borrowers across a wide range of industries, we find a significant "carbon premium" since the Paris Agreement. The loan risk premium related to CO2 emission intensity is apparent across industries and broader than that due simply to "stranded assets" in fossil fuel or other carbon-intensive industries. The price of risk, however, appears to be relatively low given the material risks faced by borrowers. Only carbon emissions directly caused by the firm (scope 1) are priced, and not the overall carbon footprint including indirect emissions. "Green" banks do not appear to price carbon risk differently from other banks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Over the past decade, non-financial firms in emerging market economies (EMEs) have rapidly built up dollar debt. This makes them vulnerable to changes in US monetary policy. If a local currency weakens against the dollar, the domestic economy may shrink rather than expand if such firms have a large stock of unhedged dollar debt. Our paper examines the evidence for this hypothesis based on Indian firm-level and macro-level data.  </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We ask whether financial effects arising from the exchange rate affect the international transmission of monetary policy, and how this "financial channel" might operate through the amount of credit in the economy. Using micro-level data, we find that the exchange rate does affect the balance sheets of non-financial firms when changes in US monetary policy influence the exchange rate. These effects are manifested in changes in firms' use of<span> domestic vis-à-vis external borrowing and in their net worth</span>. To complement the micro-level analysis, we estimate the impact of US monetary policy on the macro-financial variables.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that, when US monetary policy tightens, the financing conditions of Indian non-financial firms deteriorate, as their net worth falls and access to credit worsens. At the same time, a weakening rupee combined with higher US interest rates leads to a downturn in both the domestic credit and the business cycle. We find that the financial channel of the exchange rate  can intensify monetary policy dilemmas for the central bank.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The effect of US monetary policy on EMEs is one of the fiercely debated issues in international finance. We contribute to this debate using micro- and macro-level analyses from India over the period 2004-2019. Using a dynamic panel estimation model of non-financial firms, we show that US monetary tightening adversely affects firms' net worth and reduces domestic credit relative to external credit. Using a sign-identified VAR model, we find that the contractionary US monetary policy leads to a significant downturn in the domestic credit and business cycles. The responses of firms and the impact on the domestic credit cycle suggest that the financial channel of the exchange rate is one of the conduits transmitting US monetary policy to India.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies how income inequality affects job creation and finds that it reduces the number of jobs created by smaller firms.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>While existing research looks at the effects of inequality on households, this paper is among the first to show that income inequality also affects businesses. This evidence is based on four decades of data on top income shares across US states, combined with detailed information on job creation by firms of different sizes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Rising income inequality reduces job creation by small relative to large firms. High-income households save relatively less in the form of bank deposits than do low-income households. Thus, rising top income shares reduce banks' access to deposits and hence their ability to lend. As small firms depend more on bank financing than large firms, the contraction in lending hinders job creation at small firms. The paper provides evidence for these effects, complementing the analysis with a macroeconomic model for simulation experiments.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper shows that rising income inequality reduces job creation at small firms. High-income households save relatively less in the form of bank deposits while small firms depend on banks. We argue that a higher share of income accruing to top earners therefore erodes banks' deposit base and their lending capacity for small businesses, thus reducing job creation. Exploiting variation in top incomes across US states and an instrumental variable strategy, we establish that a 10 percentage point (pp) increase in income share of the top 10% reduces the net job creation rate of small firms by 1.5–2 pp, relative to large firms. The effects are stronger at smaller firms and in bank-dependent industries. Rising top incomes also reduce bank deposits and increase deposit rates, in line with a reduction in the supply of household deposits. We then build a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous households that face a portfolio choice between high-return investments and low-return deposits that insure against liquidity risk. Banks use deposits to lend to firms of different sizes subject to information frictions. We study job creation across firm sizes under counterfactual income distributions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Income inequality worldwide has been on an uptrend since the 1980s. We investigate whether greater income concentration at the top can affect cyclical economic outcomes. We do so by empirically analysing how changes in post-tax income inequality shape the dynamics of real per capita consumption across countries.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Several recent papers have emphasised that inequality can significantly affect the dynamics of consumption and output over the course of a business cycle. In these models, inequality affects aggregate consumption because of the negative correlation between consumers' marginal propensities to consume and their income. We investigate the extent of this mechanism, using a panel of 91 advanced and emerging market economies between 1981 and 2019 and distinguishing between expansionary and contractionary phases of the business cycle.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Distinguishing between "normal" and downturn phases of the cycle is crucial. We find that income inequality has no effect on aggregate consumption during normal times. However, greater income concentration at the top is strongly associated with deeper contractions in real per capita consumption in the aftermath of economic downturns. This finding holds for normal downturns, as well as for "financial downturns", that is, downturns accompanied by widespread financial distress. Our findings are consistent with lower propensities to consume among wealthier households and indicate that when aggregate demand falls, the distribution of income across consumers matters for subsequent economic outcomes.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using an international panel data set, we analyze the implications of rising income inequality for aggregate consumption. We document that greater concentration of (after-tax) income in the top decile is associated with a significantly larger and more persistent contraction in consumption in the aftermath of economic downturns. These findings are consistent with lower propensities to consume among wealthier households and imply that disparities in income flows at turning points of the business cycle can significantly influence macroeconomic outcomes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In the last 15 years, central banks have purchased securities at unprecedented levels via quantitative easing and foreign exchange intervention. These policies have constituted the core response to crises such as the 2008–09 Great Financial Crisis, the 2011–12 European sovereign debt crisis and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In many cases, policymakers have resorted to these policies as traditional monetary policy was constrained by the zero lower bound.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In this paper, I review recent advances in open economy analysis with financial frictions. This type of analysis offers a different take on exchange rates compared with their traditional role as shock absorbers. When international financial intermediation is imperfect, the exchange rate is pinned down by imbalances in the demand and supply of assets in different currencies and, crucially, by the limited risk-bearing capacity of the financial intermediaries that absorb these imbalances. Exchange rates are distorted by financial forces and can be a source of shocks to the real economy rather than a re-equilibrating mechanism.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Under imperfect financial markets, foreign exchange intervention is effective and, if used appropriately, can be welfare enhancing. Intervention is best used in countries with relatively shallow foreign exchange markets or when financial intermediaries are temporarily constrained. The analysis clarifies that the relevant stock of assets to affect is the balance sheet of financial institutions. Finally, it stresses the nature of foreign exchange intervention as a risk transfer from the private sector to the central bank. Therefore, foreign exchange intervention can be implemented with derivatives like currency swaps and forwards, in line with the current practice of most central banks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The ongoing digital revolution may lead to fundamental changes to the traditional model of monetary exchange. Digital currencies facilitate instantaneous peer-to-peer transfers in a way that was previously impossible. New currencies that transcend national borders could redefine how payments and user data interact. They could affect the nature of currency competition, the architecture of the international monetary system and the role of government-issued money.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper discusses the key questions and economic implications of digital currencies. It discusses how digital currencies could unbundle the traditional roles of money, lead to digital currency areas that cover multiple countries, and move payments away from banks' credit provision towards digital platforms. These changes could influence the transmission of monetary policy and necessitate the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, digital currencies will unbundle the traditional functions served by money, ie store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account, creating fiercer competition among currencies. Second, digital money issuers will try to differentiate their products (ie currency) by re-bundling monetary functions with eg data gathering and social networking services. In combination with digital connectedness, new currencies could lead to digital currency areas linking the currency to the use of a particular digital network rather than to a specific country. This raises the risk of "digital dollarisation", in which the national currency is supplanted by the currency of a (systemically important) digital platform. Third, digital currencies affect the competition between private and public money. Cash could disappear, and payments could centre around digital platforms rather than banks' credit provision. Governments may need to offer CBDCs in order to retain monetary independence.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The ongoing digital revolution may lead to a radical departure from the traditional model of monetary exchange. We may see an unbundling of the separate roles of money, creating fiercer competition among specialized currencies. On the other hand, digital currencies associated with large platform ecosystems may lead to a re-bundling of money in which payment services are packaged with an array of data services, encouraging differentiation but discouraging interoperability between platforms. Digital currencies may also cause an upheaval of the international monetary system: countries that are socially or digitally integrated with their neighbors may face digital dollarization, and the prevalence of systemically important platforms could lead to the emergence of digital currency areas that transcend national borders. Central bank digital currency (CBDC) ensures that public money remains a relevant unit of account.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the monetary-fiscal mix in the European Monetary Union. When economies are hit by large shocks, such as the Covid crisis, the pre-set fiscal rules in a monetary union could be a constraint and offset the conduct of accommodative monetary policy. In addition, a more active fiscal policy could be a powerful tool to stabilise economic conditions when short-term interest rates hit the zero lower bound. The paper develops an econometric framework to study the dynamics between primary deficits, yields and returns, the market value of the debt, and inflation, under different monetary policy scenarios.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper extends the literature, which has long focused on the United States, to a monetary union. It thus allows a scrutiny of the dynamic interaction between a single central bank and multiple fiscal authorities. In addition, the paper provides a new quarterly fiscal dataset of market value of government debts for the four main euro area economies covering the period 1991–2019.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds that fiscal policy in the monetary union responds differently under various monetary policy scenarios. In response to a conventional easing of the policy rate – reduction in short-term interest rates – fiscal policy leans in the same direction. The increase in fiscal deficit will be absorbed by that in inflation in the long run. Conversely, in response to an unconventional easing – through term spread compression at the long end of the yield curve – primary fiscal surplus barely moves and the discount rate declines strongly. The long-run effect of unconventional monetary easing on inflation is about half than that of conventional. These results vary little across countries.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the monetary-fiscal mix in the European Monetary Union. The medium and long-run effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy can be analysed by combining monetary policy shocks identified in a Structural VAR, and the general government budget constraint featuring a single central bank and multiple fiscal authorities. In response to a conventional easing of the policy rate, the real discount rate declines, absorbing the increase in deficit due to the fiscal policy leaning towards the easing. Conversely, in response to an unconventional easing of the long end of the yield curve, the discount rate declines strongly, while the primary fiscal surplus barely moves. The long-run effect of unconventional monetary easing on inflation is about half than that of conventional, a result which is also consistent with the muted response of fiscal policy. Results do not point to large differences across countries.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Governments in advanced economies are enjoying extraordinary times. In spite of unprecedented public debt levels and consistent if not large, fiscal deficits, yields on public debt are at historical lows. In many countries, yields have even been negative for some years, sparing them the explosion in public debt-to-GDP ratio that could happen with higher yields. But why is this so, and what does this imply for governments going forward?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper starts with two observations: the interest rate on US government debt (r) has been below the growth rate of output (g), while the marginal product of capital (m) is above the growth rate of output (g). Based on these observations, the paper addresses three questions. First, what drives the wedges between the yield on government debt r, the growth rate of the economy g, and the marginal return to capital m? Second, given these wedges, is there a level, beyond which public debt becomes unsustainable? Last, how do monetary and fiscal policy affect the government's budget constraint, through their impact on the different wedges?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper builds a model where agents have opportunities for investment but face risks as well as financial constraints. By contrast, holding public debt carries no risks. This framework then delivers three predictions. First, the wedge m–r typically increases with public spending. Second, however, the amount of public debt agents are willing to hold decreases with the amount of public spending. Third, there is a maximum level of public spending beyond which the wedge m-r is not sustainable.</p>
<p>In addition, the paper notes that expected inflation does not affect fiscal space, while inflation volatility lowers the safety of public debt and therefore tightens the government budget constraint. Alternatively, financial repression can also create fiscal space, but this comes at the cost of resource misallocation and thereby lower growth. Redistributive policies in turn, to the extent they reduce growth, would rather reduce fiscal space.</p>
<p>To wrap up, there is still a meaningful constraint on how much the government can spend, when r&lt;g&lt;m. Yet, policies can loosen or tighten this constraint through their effect on these three different variables.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>With real interest rates below the growth rate of the economy, but the marginal product of capital above it, the public debt can be lower than the present value of primary surpluses because of a bubble premia on the debt. The government can run a deficit forever. In a model that endogenizes the bubble premium as arising from the safety and liquidity of public debt, more government spending requires a larger bubble premium, but because people want to hold less debt, there is an upper limit on spending.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When a clearing member defaults, the central counterparty (CCP) organises an auction to sell the member's portfolio to surviving members. The higher the price of the auctioned portfolio, the lower the default loss, and thus the smaller the extent to which the CCP taps into the so-called guarantee fund, which is prefunded by members. To safeguard its resilience and reputation, the CCP seeks to encourage active bidding and minimise the default loss. We propose a tractable model to examine the design of CCP auctions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>CCPs are systemically important. We contribute to the ongoing policy discussions of CCP auctions and to the academic literature on auction design and central clearing. Our model incorporates salient institutional aspects of CCP auctions and delivers novel results. In particular, we analyse a key design feature of CCP auctions – juniorisation, ie the process by which the CCP first uses the prefunded cash of members who submit less competitive bids. Concretely, we assume that each clearing member participates in covering the CCP's default loss with a fraction of its contribution to the guarantee fund, and that this fraction is adjusted downward in proportion to the amount that the member purchases at the auction. Our results shed light on how juniorisation affects the CCP's default loss as well as members' bidding behaviour and profits.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that juniorisation increases the price of the auctioned portfolio and reduces the default loss. It is possible to design a juniorisation scheme that almost eliminates the need to use the guarantee fund, which protects the CCP's reputation. However, juniorisation penalises members with small guarantee fund contributions: their auction-related profits decline as they are sidelined by the more aggressive bids of larger members. It also penalises members with the largest contributions, which end up being the only ones covering the CCP's default loss. All these penalties benefit members with intermediate contributions.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Central counterparties (CCPs) are systemically important. When a clearing member defaults, the CCP sells the defaulted portfolio to surviving members in an auction, and losses, if any, are partly absorbed by a cash pool prefunded by the surviving members. We propose a tractable auction model that incorporates this salient feature. We find that "juniorization" – the CCP first uses prefunded cash of members who submit bad bids – increases the auction price. Aggressive juniorization can push the auction price above the fair value and almost eliminate the need to use prefunded resources. Nonetheless, juniorization generates heterogeneous impact on members of different sizes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Climate change is perhaps the greatest challenge of our time. It poses unprecedented risks to our economies. By the end of the century, global temperatures are likely to rise by 3 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, and could rise even more. To avoid a climate catastrophe we need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide that drives climate change. Therefore, our economies need to change. To devise the right policies, policymakers need to map macroeconomic variables into carbon emissions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We map macroeconomic outcomes into carbon emissions. We use comprehensive data from a panel of 121 countries over the 1971–2016 period. We link per capita carbon emissions to key macroeconomic variables, such as GDP growth, the level of urbanisation and the energy mix (coal, oil and renewable energy sources). We study both advanced and emerging market economies, and also different time periods.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that carbon emissions rise with economic development, manufacturing activity, urbanisation and, increasingly, economic growth. We also find that in electricity generation, the use of coal, and to a lesser degree of oil, is associated with high emissions. In contrast, renewable energy use is already associated with lower aggregate emissions in advanced economies. We also uncover that economic overheating is particularly harmful when coal use is higher. Our results suggest that mitigating economic cycles can also reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use a comprehensive database of 121 countries over the 1971-2016 period to study how macroeconomic factors drive carbon (carbon-dioxide) emissions. For this purpose, dynamic panel regressions are estimated. Carbon emissions rise with economic development, manufacturing activity, urbanization and increasingly with economic growth. In electricity generation, the use of coal, and to a lesser degree of oil, is associated with higher carbon emissions, while renewable energy use is already associated with lower national emissions in advanced economies. We also uncover a non-linearity: economic overheating is particularly harmful when coal use is more intensive. The results suggest that mitigating economic cycles might also reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>With euro area inflation and professionals' long-term euro area inflation expectations persistently below the European Central Bank's inflation aim, a key question for the ECB is whether long-term inflation expectations have de-anchored. To date, most of the empirical work has relied on measures of expectations of professionals, while little is known about the expectations of firms and of households. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We investigate whether consumers' long-term expectations of euro area inflation are well anchored to the ECB's inflation aim. We use data from a new survey of Dutch consumers' long-term expectations of inflation in the euro area and the Netherlands. The survey is a new satellite survey of the Household Survey of De Nederlandsche Bank. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that long-term euro area inflation expectations held by Dutch households are not well anchored to the ECB's inflation aim. Importantly, unlike market participants and professional forecasters, Dutch households appear to be concerned about higher, not lower, euro area inflation in the long run.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We provide new evidence on the level and probability distribution of consumers' longterm expectations of inflation in the euro area and the Netherlands, using a representative Dutch survey. We find that consumers' long-term (ten years ahead) euro area inflation expectations are not well anchored at the ECB's inflation aim. First, median long-term euro area inflation expectations are 4%, 2pp above the ECB's inflation aim of 2%. Second, individual probability distributions of long-term euro area inflation expectations show that expected probabilities of higher inflation (2pp or more above the ECB's inflation aim) are much higher, at 28% on average, than those of lower inflation (2pp or more below the ECB's inflation aim), at 12%. This suggest that the de-anchoring of Dutch consumers' long-term euro area inflation expectations is mainly due to expected high inflation, rather than to expected low inflation (or deflation). This finding is in contrast to recent concerns by ECB monetary policymakers about a possible deanchoring of long-term inflation expectations on the downside. Furthermore, we find that consumers' long-term euro area inflation expectations are significantly higher if respondents have lower incomes. Based on measures of anchoring calculated directly from individual consumers' probability distributions of expected long-term inflation, namely the probability of inflation being close to target, the probability of inflation being far above target, and the probability of deflation, we also find that long-term euro area inflation expectations are better anchored for consumers with higher net household income.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>During the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09, policymakers intervened to prevent the failure of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and to alleviate turmoil in the financial system. Following the GFC, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced measures to reduce the likelihood and severity of a G-SIB failure in the future. Capital requirements corresponding to measures of systemic importance, along with other post-GFC reforms, increased the going-concern loss absorbency of G-SIBs and improved the resilience of the banking sector. The expected impact framework provides a theoretical foundation for these capital requirements based on systemic importance, which are often referred to as G-SIB surcharges. Our alternative implementation of the expected impact framework has the potential to improve the empirical basis of these surcharges and eliminate uneven incentives for G-SIB growth.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We contribute to the banking regulation literature by introducing enhancements to the current implementation of the G-SIB surcharges that could strengthen its empirical foundation and eliminate cliff effects. First, we use Extreme Value Theory to estimate an explicit probability of default function for G-SIBs. Second, we demonstrate the potential of density-based cluster analysis for calculating the reference bank score necessary for the G-SIB surcharge calculation. Third, we demonstrate that alternative approaches to calibrating loss given default (LGD) could allow for equal treatment of all indicators of systemic importance, including the substitutability indicator. Fourth, we introduce two options for a simple and continuous G-SIB surcharge function that combine parameters from the PD function, LGD function, and reference bank score, with the aim of smoothing incentives to grow across G-SIB scores.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that these empirically-based alternative implementations of the expected impact framework would result in minor declines in G-SIB surcharges in the aggregate, but would result in the removal of some of the smaller G-SIBs from the list of G-SIBs. Adopting the "supervisory" surcharge function, which is calibrated to maintain the general level of capital surcharges based on the current supervisory consensus, would result in changes of less than 30 bps in individual G-SIB scores, and in moderate changes in G-SIB surcharges. Adopting a surcharge function that uses CoVaR as a measure of LGD would result in both more significant increases in capital and more significant declines in G-SIB scores and surcharges. These findings suggest that these functions could be used to monitor current G-SIB surcharges, particularly by highlighting gains from the cap on the substitutability score and from cliff effects.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>As developed by the BCBS, the expected impact framework is the theoretical foundation for calibrating the capital surcharge applied to global systemically important banks (G-SIB surcharge). This paper describes four improvements to the current implementation of the BCBS expected impact framework. We (i) introduce a theoretically sound and an empirically grounded approach to estimating a probability of default (PD) function; (ii) apply density-based cluster analysis to identify the reference bank for each G-SIB indicator; (iii) recalibrate the systemic loss-given-default (LGD) function that determines G-SIB scores, using both the current system based on supervisory judgment and using an alternative system based on CoVaR; and (iv) derive a continuous capital surcharge function to determine G-SIB capital surcharges.</p>
<p>Our approach would strengthen the empirical and theoretical foundation of the G-SIB surcharge framework. Moreover, the continuous surcharge function would reduce banks' incentive to manage their balance sheets to reduce systemic capital surcharges, mitigate cliff effects, allow for the lifting of the cap on the substitutability score and penalise growth in the category for all G-SIBs. In addition, our two capital surcharge functions might be used to monitor G-SIBs' capital adequacy and distortions induced by G-SIB surcharges.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '31 March 2021', 'title': 'An empirical foundation for calibrating the G-SIB surcharge', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work935.htm', 'author': 'Alexander Jiron, Wayne Passmore, Aurite Werman', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work935.pdf'}

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented health shock that has simultaneously affected demand, supply and financial conditions around the globe. Central banks have reacted strongly, using a range of different measures to shore up financial markets and mitigate the adverse economic impact of the pandemic. A key policy question going forward will be how promptly, strongly and effectively different central banks responded to the crisis.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We present a new database that provides details of central banks' monetary policy responses to Covid-19. By collecting these on a comparable basis across 39 economies, we can help researchers evaluate different central banks' policies. Our starting point is central banks' public announcements of monetary policy measures. We classify these into different types of tools: interest rate measures, reserve policies, lending operations, asset purchase programmes and foreign exchange operations. We provide further details relevant to each type of tool, such as the maturity and whether the instrument was new to the central bank or not. We also provide a dashboard to visualise the data graphically.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>To illustrate the usefulness of the database, we compare how advanced economy and emerging market central banks have reacted to the crisis. Many of the tools deployed were similar across the two groups. However, policy actions in advanced economies involved mainly lending operations or asset purchases, and generally required extending measures that had already been previously employed. Emerging market central banks also resorted extensively to lending operations but their recourse to other policies differed. They made more use of interest rate, foreign exchange and reserve policies, and less of asset purchases. Moreover, many emerging market central banks ventured into asset purchase policies for the first time during the pandemic. Another major difference related to foreign exchange operations. With the exception of extending swap lines, advanced economy central banks generally played only a limited role in foreign exchange markets. By contrast, emerging market central banks intervened more heavily, often relying on derivatives to influence exchange rates.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has been a global shock of unprecedented size that has hit most countries around the world. Central banks have responded quickly, on a massive scale. We present a novel database that provides information on central banks' responses to Covid-19 in 39 economies, including both advanced and emerging market economies. Monetary policy announcements are listed and classified under five types of tools: interest rate measures, reserve policies, lending operations, asset purchase programmes and foreign exchange operations. Within each category, the database provides additional information such as maturity, eligible counterparties, types of assets and the availability of fiscal backup. It also indicates whether the policy tool was newly introduced or had been previously deployed. The database has a companion dashboard to visualise the data graphically.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>As the asset management sector has grown over the past decades, so has its impact on financial market liquidity. A recurrent argument is that asset managers exacerbate market stress because their liquidity mismatches come to the fore alongside dealer banks' constrained balance sheet capacity. Focusing on banks' role as market-makers, this paper examines the implications of their regulatory constraints on asset managers' risk-taking behaviour.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We challenge the notion that bank regulation necessarily amplifies asset managers' destabilising behaviour – a notion that rests on the assumption that more liquidity is always better. We argue instead that in assessing cross-sectoral implications of bank regulation, it is crucial to establish whether there are distortions in the asset management sector that make it inherently prone to excessive risk-taking. We study the data for evidence of one such distortion – reputational herding.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find evidence consistent with reputational – as opposed to information-driven – herding by US money market funds. In our theoretical model, we derive conditions under which such herding leads asset managers to take on excessive liquidity risk. When this is the case, the model implies that bank regulation plays a beneficial role by disciplining risk-taking in the asset management sector. In other words, a binding leverage ratio requirement raises social welfare.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We challenge the argument that bank regulation amplifies the adverse effect of asset managers' fire sales. Evidence from investments by US money market funds over the past decade is consistent with asset managers herding for reputational reasons. In the presence of such herding, we derive that the asset management sector may take on too much liquidity risk from a social perspective. Importantly, asset managers' investment decisions today are affected by the spread that banks will charge for absorbing fire sales tomorrow. When regulation constrains banks' balance-sheet space, the resulting higher spread reins in asset managers' excessive risk-taking, thus raising social welfare.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The end of the Covid-19 pandemic may be within sight following the gradual rollout of vaccinations globally. However, unexpected setbacks could still disrupt the "pandexit" process and put the global recovery at risk. For example, the pace of vaccination progress in various countries and regions is uneven and may face roadblocks; virus mutations could also bring a new set of challenges. What are the macroeconomic implications should these risks materialise? This is a vital question to consider when designing macroeconomic policies during the pandexit. Addressing it requires a joint analysis of epidemiology and economics. The challenge is to have a data-driven framework that is simple to implement, yet can flexibly accommodate a range of scenarios and country context.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper proposes a simple and flexible epidemiological-economic framework to assess the economic outlook during the pandexit. The epidemiological bloc extends the classic SEIR model to allow for variable infection and death rates, as well as vaccination and possible reinfection due to virus mutations. The economic bloc describes how the society balances between lives and livelihood. A fast and robust algorithm is introduced to match the model to daily health and mobility data. Several pertinent scenarios are analysed, but many more could be built. Regular updates of the results are available online, together with open-source codes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Under the baseline scenario, the median output loss across 27 economies in 2021 is about 2.25% of pre-pandemic trends. This assumes no further spikes in infection rate and sustained vaccination progress. In the downside scenario of slow vaccinations or a surge in infection rates, median output loss could grow to between 3 and 3.75%. The most severe scenario entails virus mutations that result in the loss of immunity, including among those vaccinated. In this case, median output loss could reach 5% in 2021 alone, and activity restrictions may persist in subsequent years.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper proposes a quantitative framework to analyse the interactions between epidemiological and economic developments, and assesses the macroeconomic impact of managing the late stage of the Covid-19 pandemic. The framework features a susceptible-exposed- infectious-recovered (SEIR)-type model that describes the pandemic evolution conditional on society's mobility choice, and a policy unit that chooses mobility optimally to balance lives and livelihood objectives. The model can be matched to daily data via a fast and robust empirical procedure, allowing a timely policy analysis as situations evolve. As of 10 March 2021, the projected median output loss across 27 advanced and emerging market economies in 2021 is about 2 1/4% of pre-pandemic trends. This projected outcome hinges on a sustained progress in vaccination and no major epidemiological setbacks. Vaccination impediments or a third-wave surge in infection rate could raise median output loss to 3 - 3 3/4%. In the most severe scenario, virus mutations that compromise existing immunity could require more protracted lockdowns. In this case, median output loss may reach 5% in 2021 alone, with further repercussions in subsequent years.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Financial inclusion is a key goal for policymakers around the world. Yet women remain unbanked or underbanked relative to men: they have lower access to transaction accounts, credit and other financial services. Hopes are high that new ﬁnancial technology ("ﬁntech") can enhance ﬁnancial inclusion and close the gender gap in access to ﬁnancial services. Yet evidence on adoption rates of fintech products and services by gender has so far been scarce.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a novel survey of over 27,000 adults from 28 major economies to investigate gender diﬀerences in the adoption of new ﬁnancial technology. The survey asks detailed questions about individuals' use of and attitude towards 19 categories of ﬁntech products and services provided by ﬁntech entrants and by traditional ﬁnancial institutions. It also includes individual characteristics. This allows us to systematically assess gender differences in the use of fintech and potential drivers at the individual and country level.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The survey shows a large "fintech gender gap": while 29% of men use ﬁntech products and services, only 21% of women do. The gap is present in almost every country in our sample. It is roughly the same size for products provided by fintech entrants and those offered by traditional financial institutions. The econometric analysis reveals that country characteristics and individual-level controls explain about a third of the gap. Gender diﬀerences in the willingness to use new ﬁnancial technology or ﬁntech entrants if they oﬀer cheaper services account for over half of the remaining difference.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Fintech promises to spur financial inclusion and close the gender gap in access to financial services. Using novel survey data for 28 countries, this paper finds a large 'fintech gender gap': while 29% of men use fintech products and services, only 21% of women do. The gap is present in almost every country in our sample. Country characteristics and several individual-level controls explain about a third of the unconditional gap. Gender differences in the willingness to use new financial technology or fintech entrants if they offer cheaper services account for over half of the remaining gap. The paper concludes by suggesting potential explanations for the gender gap and implications for challenges in fostering financial inclusion with new technology.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The world is changing and so is the way it is measured. For decades, policymakers and the private sector have relied on data released by official statistical institutions to assess the state of the economy. Collecting these data requires substantial effort and publication often happens following a lag of several months, even years. However, the last years have seen explosive growth in the amount of readily available data, as well as in the technology and software used to analyse it. These developments have spurred central banks' interest in big data and machine learning.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper provides an overview on the use of big data and machine learning in the central bank community. It leverages on a survey conducted in 2020 among the members of the Irving Fischer Committee. The survey contains responses from 52 central banks from all regions of the world and examines how they define and use big data, as well as which opportunities and challenges they see.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The analysis highlights four main insights. First, central banks define big data in an encompassing way that includes unstructured non-traditional as well as structured data sets. Second, central banks' interest in big data and machine learning has markedly increased over the last years: around 80% of central banks discuss the topic of big data formally within their institution, up from 30% in 2015. Third, the vast majority of central banks are now conducting projects that involve big data. Institutions use big data and machine learning for economic research, in the areas of financial stability and monetary policy, as well as for suptech and regtech applications. And fourth, the advent of big data poses new challenges, among them data quality, legal aspects around privacy, algorithmic fairness and confidentiality, as well as budget constraints. Cooperation among public authorities could relax the constraints on collecting, storing and analysing big data.</p>

<p>This paper reviews the use of big data and machine learning in central banking, leveraging on a recent survey conducted among the members of the Irving Fischer Committee (IFC). The majority of central banks discuss the topic of big data formally within their institution. Big data is used with machine learning applications in a variety of areas, including research, monetary policy and financial stability. Central banks also report using big data for supervision and regulation (suptech and regtech applications). Data quality, sampling and representativeness are major challenges for central banks, and so is legal uncertainty around data privacy and confidentiality. Several institutions report constraints in setting up an adequate IT infrastructure and in developing the necessary human capital. Cooperation among public authorities could improve central banks' ability to collect, store and analyse big data.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The momentum toward greening the economy brings with it a number of new transition risks, which, if not properly addressed, may threaten financial stability. In particular, the expectation that other investors may exclude high carbon corporate emitters from their portfolio creates a risk of runs on brown assets. Understanding and acknowledging this new source of financial instability is essential for government agencies in charge of preserving the soundness of financial systems.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We analyse whether a market economy where polluting firms are subject to a run risk can sufficiently incentivise those firms to reduce their carbon emissions, and how the laissez faire allocation fares relative to one that could be provided by policymakers. We postulate that uncertainty on the level of carbon-emission intensity that will be tolerated by consumers, investors or regulators can result in runs on significant shares of financial assets. In this context, we propose a liquidity backstop facility that helps restore efficiency. We show how offering such a backstop, whose access fee is proportional to the carbon emission of corporates, can prevent such runs while greening output.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In anticipation of a risk of runs on brown assets and a resulting pooling equilibrium, low- and high-emissions firms are not easily differentiated by external investors. As a result, all firms face the same initial funding costs ahead of production, and some high-emissions firms will be unable to subsequently refinance their activity because investors will not take the risk of financing them.</p>
<p>The findings also show that a liquidity backstop – whose pricing takes the form of an access fee proportional to carbon emissions, and a borrowing rate that is independent of carbon emissions – helps in greening the economy, re-establishing production efficiency, while avoiding runs. The access fee incentivises the highest emissions firms to opt for cleaner technologies and to reduce their output while greener firms increase their scale of production.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The momentum toward greening the economy implies transition risks that are new threats to financial stability. In particular, the expectation that other investors may exclude high carbon corporate emitters from their portfolio creates a risk of runs on brown assets. We show that runs can be contained by a liquidity backstop with an access fee that depends on the firm's carbon intensity, while the interest rate on the liquidity lent through this facility is independent from its carbon intensity.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the variation across firms' use of bond financing relative to financing through loan facilities and examine firm-level characteristics that may help explain such cross-firm financing variation. We contrast the debt specialisation and diversification of US firms with that of firms in Asia – a region with rapidly growing bond markets.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Why do some firms borrow using only revolving credit facilities while others borrow exclusively through privately placed bonds? Why does bank debt comprise 90% of some firms' debt while publicly traded bonds comprise 90% of other firms' debt? We contribute to the large literature that asks these and similar questions, investigating the debt composition of more than 100,000 firm-year observations in the United States and across nine Asian markets.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We uncover a strong U-shape in bond financing by US firms. Small firms and large firms tend to use much more bond financing relative to loan financing than do mid-size firms. There is no corresponding U-shape in less developed Asian markets, while the advanced markets of Hong Kong SAR and Korea are in the middle. These patterns – and, more generally, the cross-firm variation in firms' use of bond financing relative to financing through loan facilities – are largely unrelated to either credit quality or monitoring effectiveness. Instead, we argue that market segmentation drives these shapes.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We uncover a strong U-shape in bond financing by US firms. Firms with total debt in the range of $10 million to $100 million tend to use much less bond financing relative to loan financing than do firms with more or less total debt. There is no corresponding U-shape in less-developed Asian markets, while the advanced markets of Hong Kong SAR and Korea are in the middle. These patterns, and more generally the cross-firm variation in firms' use of bond financing relative to financing through loan facilities, are largely unrelated to either credit quality or monitoring effectiveness. This suggests that market segmentation is more likely. Finally, we find evidence of debt diversification by highly-leveraged firms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007–09 has highlighted the limits of traditional policies in addressing the potential negative effects of credit and asset price cycles on financial stability. In response, central banks and regulators have increasingly relied on long-advocated macroprudential policies (MaPs). Together with various other post-GFC reforms, including the Basel III framework and closer supervisory oversight, MaPs have increased the resilience of banking systems around the world. However, two factors may limit the efficacy of MaPs for overall financial stability: the growth of a less regulated non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector; and the possible presence of spillover effects across jurisdictions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Using data for 24 jurisdictions participating in the Financial Stability Board's monitoring exercise over the period 2002–17, we study how MaPs affect the size of the NBFI sector domestically and internationally. In particular, we focus on NBFI activities that may involve bank-like financial stability risks. We contribute to the literature in two ways. First, on the domestic side, we test if a tightening (easing) of MaPs is associated with an increase (decrease) in financial activities in NBFI. Second, we test for cross-country spillovers by estimating whether the use of MaPs in foreign jurisdictions affects the size of the NBFI sector domestically.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that a net tightening of domestic MaPs increases NBFI activities and decreases bank assets, raising the NBFI share in total financial assets. By contrast, a net tightening of MaPs in foreign jurisdictions leads to a reduction of the NBFI share – the effect of a drop of NBFI assets and an increase in banking activity domestically. When we distinguish between tightening and easing of MaPs, we observe that the effects are by and large symmetric. The effect of MaPs (domestic and foreign) is economically and statistically significant for all NBFI economic functions that may pose risks to financial stability. Our finding of the presence of externalities calls for international coordination in the development and enactment of MaPs.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We analyse how macroprudential policies (MaPs), largely applied to banks and to a lesser extent borrowers, affect non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI). Using data for 24 of the jurisdictions participating in the Financial Stability Board's monitoring exercise over the period 2002–17, we study the effects of MaP episodes on bank assets and on those NBFI activities that may involve bank-like financial stability risks (the narrow measure of NBFI). We find that a net tightening of domestic MaPs increases these NBFI activities and decreases bank assets, raising the NBFI share in total financial assets. By contrast, a net tightening of MaPs in foreign jurisdictions leads to a reduction of the NBFI share – the effect of a drop in NBFI activities and an increase in domestic banking assets. Tightening and easing MaPs have largely symmetric effects on NBFI. We find that the effect of MaPs (both domestic and foreign) is economically and statistically significant for all those NBFI economic functions that may pose risks to financial stability.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Financial crises wreak economic, social and political havoc. They impose large fiscal costs, driving up public debt and disrupting our societies. Designing and implementing policies that reduce the chances of a crisis occurring – as well as its costs – requires the build-up of risk in the economy to be recognised at an early stage. This paper is an attempt to restore some imagination to the economics of crises.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We adapt the framework of sequential prediction or online machine learning to forecast systemic financial crises without knowing the "true" model of the economy. Our approach can be described as "meta-statistic", since the aim is to make the best possible prediction by aggregating predictions from different models. These models are estimated using the standard macroeconomic variables used in past studies. Our methodology and results may be useful for the conduct of macroprudential policy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We uncover a time-varying subset of models that carry most of the information needed to predict financial crises. Among those models, we also discuss which ones "flash red" at the right time. Using a mix of 26 models for France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom – including central bank financial crises models as well as machine learning models – we are able to predict a systemic financial crisis three years ahead out-of-sample, with lower signal-to-noise ratios than in the existing literature.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Financial crises cause economic, social and political havoc. Macroprudential policies are gaining traction but are still severely under-researched compared to monetary policy and fiscal policy. We use the general framework of sequential predictions also called online machine learning to forecast crises out-of-sample. Our methodology is based on model averaging and is "meta-statistic" since we can incorporate any predictive model of crises in our set of experts and test its ability to add information. We are able to predict systemic financial crises twelve quarters ahead out-of-sample with high signal-to-noise ratio in most cases. We analyse which experts provide the most information for our predictions at each point in time and for each country, allowing us to gain some insights into economic mechanisms underlying the building of risk in economies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Chinese growth has been the main engine of the global economy for the past two decades. However, after the government announced in 2012 that it aimed to double real GDP by 2020, the country's aggregate growth statistics have been disappointingly flat and econometric analyses have been increasingly difficult to conduct. In this paper, instead of using aggregate growth statistics, we exploit a Chinese macroeconomic data set at the provincial level for 1999–2019 and take advantage of its larger statistical variation.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We show that provincial data help to forecast aggregate economic activity in China and introduce a new alternative indicator for Chinese growth that will be updated and published quarterly. We also reveal that the growth determinants have changed substantially over time. The importance of government expenditure and credit is increasing, while that of investment and productivity in urban areas is falling. Lastly, we introduce an easy-to-update method for pinpointing changes in the underlying determinants of Chinese growth.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find robust evidence that, when used, the richness of provincial data helps us understand and project Chinese aggregate growth. Our alternative growth indicator can reveal fluctuations not present in the official statistical series. Looking at the determinants of growth, we find that before 2010 Chinese growth was more dependent on productivity, urban employment and investment. After 2010, however, growth has been increasingly supported by government expenditure and credit. These new growth determinants now also apply more uniformly to a larger group of Chinese provinces.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>It is important to understand the growth process under way in China. However, analyses of Chinese growth became increasingly more difficult after the real GDP doubling target was announced in 2012 and the official real GDP statistics lost their fluctuations. With a dataset covering 31 Chinese provinces from two decades, we have substantially more variation to work with. We find robust evidence that the richness of the provincial data provides information relevant to understand and project Chinese aggregates. Using this provincial data, we build an alternative indicator for Chinese growth that is able to reveal fluctuations not present in the official statistical series. Additionally, we concentrate on the determinants of Chinese growth and show how the drivers have gone through a substantial change over time both across economic variables and provinces. We introduce a method to understand the changing nature of Chinese growth that can be updated regularly using principal components derived from the provincial data.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Blockchain technology breathes new life into the classical analysis of "money as memory," ie as a substitute for a ledger of all past transactions, where holding money is a record of goods sold and services rendered. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a record-keeping device that has no need of a central authority to support trading. But can it do so more efficiently and robustly than a traditional, centralised exchange? And how can a balance be struck between decentralisation, a robust consensus, and adequate transaction flow, as set out in Buterin's "Blockchain trilemma"?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper models the incentives that validators need to sustain an honest exchange and asks whether it is optimal to have a central intermediary or a network of validators. DLT differs from conventional centralised marketplaces in that (i) it is easier to achieve good governance in decentralised settings and (ii) the actions of multiple validators need to be coordinated via economic incentives. Validators require rents in order to overcome free-riding. To reach an optimal design, therefore, two factors need to be balanced: (i) the need for greater robustness derived from a more decentralised governance structure, and (ii) the increasing difficulty of coordinating a larger network of validators.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that under specific circumstances, DLT may have economic potential in financial markets and payments due to its enhanced robustness and the potentially lower cost of achieving good governance in a decentralised network of validators, as compared with a central intermediary. However, such improvements do not come for free; ie market design matters, as does calibrating the incentives of the validators. To maintain a robust monetary equilibrium, it is necessary to prevent validators from exploiting their powerful position, which in turn requires high rents and the absence of unanimity. We examine these dynamics and derive the optimal number of validators, their compensation and the optimal voting rule. In this context, we pose Buterin's "scalability trilemma" formally within our monetary economy and show the optimal balance between decentralization, security (i.e. a robust consensus), and scale (ie the efficient volume of transactions).</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Blockchain technology breathes new life into the classical analysis of money as a substitute for a ledger of all past transactions. On this view, money is a record of goods sold and services rendered. While blockchain technology involves updating the ledger through a decentralised consensus on the unique truth, the robustness of the equilibrium that supports this consensus depends on who has access to the ledger and how it can be updated. To find the optimal solution, Buterin's "scalability trilemma" needs to be addressed, so that a workable balance can be found between decentralisation, security (i.e. a robust consensus), and scale (ie the efficient volume of transactions). Using a global game analysis of an exchange economy with credit, we solve for the optimal ledger design that balances the three objectives of this trilemma. We find that, depending on dynamic incentives, either decentralised or centralised designs can be optimal, with the case for decentralisation being stronger in myopic markets.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study situations where banks need to swiftly recapitalise and analyse implications for banks' leverage and recapitalisation strategies. An ongoing example is the Covid-19 crisis, in which financial regulators have appealed to banks worldwide to manage their capital buffers wisely. Banks' private leverage choices ahead of such events can differ from what policymakers prescribe as socially optimal. In addition, not all recapitalisation strategies are equally well suited once systemic capital shortfalls arise. We offer a theoretical framework to study both of these issues.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The role of bank capital as a buffer is a key motivation for regulatory requirements in the Basel Framework. In addition, following the 2008 GFC, the mitigation of systemic risks with the help of macroprudential tools has received growing attention. We identify the externalities of banks' leverage choices that have systemic implications. We also draw attention to how bank capital regulation can have novel macroprudential aspects, specifically given banks' capital structure management through asset and liability side operations in cases of distress.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our general equilibrium model of bank capitalisation with segmented financial markets predicts banks to be inefficiently undercapitalised. This leads to excessive capital shortages during systemic events and causes bank failures. The model further identifies a destabilising effect of asset side recapitalisations at the bank-specific and systemic level when compared with equity issuances. As banks may nevertheless prefer asset side recapitalisations, optimal regulation calls for a combination of leverage requirements and a macroprudential tool that induces banks to recapitalise in a socially optimal way. Our model further provides a rationale for cooperation among national financial regulators in mandatory recapitalisations and macroprudential leverage regulation. Finally, our results can argue for staggered stress tests and against extensive simultaneous testing exercises.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study optimal bank leverage and recapitalization in general equilibrium when the supply of specialized investment capital is imperfectly elastic. Assuming incomplete insurance against capital shortfalls and segmented financial markets, ex-ante leverage is inefficiently high, leading to excessive insolvencies during systemic capital shortfall events. Recapitalizations by equity issuance are individually and socially optimal. Additional frictions can turn asset sales individually but not necessarily socially optimal. Our results hold for different bankruptcy protocols and we offer testable predictions for banks' capital structure management. Our model provides a rationale for macroprudential capital regulation that does not require moral hazard or informational asymmetries.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Did the enhanced regulatory framework put in place following the Great Financial Crisis lead to a systemic footprint reduction among large global banks? Has the response to the new rules differed across banks? We explore these questions through the lens of banks' diverse incentives to lower their footprint. While these incentives may be particularly attractive for banks facing high costs of raising capital, they may not be strong enough for banks that stand to lose a great deal from downsizing.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our analysis unveils the effect of the new regulatory framework on large global banks by benchmarking their response against the one of unaffected peer institutions. We show that profitability is a key – but often overlooked – determinant of banks' responses to regulatory reforms. Moreover, we establish a novel application of textual analysis to banks' annual reports in order to identify when the regulatory reform started affecting bank behaviour. This approach overcomes identification challenges that arise from the gradual implementation of new regulation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We highlight the differential impact of the regulatory framework on large global banks. Only the less profitable ones reduced their systemic importance relative to equally unprofitable peers that were unaffected by the framework. The reduction was even stronger for those banks that were close to the regulatory thresholds that determine their capital surcharges. By contrast, the more profitable large global banks continued to raise their systemic footprint. The impact of the framework remains unnoticed if we study only its average effect on banks.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Regulatory reforms following the financial crisis of 2007–08 created incentives for large global banks to lower their systemic importance. We establish that differences in profitability shape banks' response to these reforms. Indeed, profitability is key because it underpins banks' ability to generate capital and drives the opportunity cost of shrinking. Our analysis shows that only the less profitable banks lowered their systemic footprint relative to their equally unprofitable peers that were unaffected by the regulatory treatment. The more profitable banks, by contrast, continued to raise their systemic importance in sync with their untreated peers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Investors can extract information about future stock returns from options. Unlike those on equity indices, options on individual companies are often illiquid and are typically useful for learning about only the central part of the return distribution. Other derivatives known as credit default swaps (CDS) can shed light on the probability of extreme returns. However, investors have limited insights on the probability of intermediate returns, which are larger (in absolute value) than those for which options are informative but smaller than extreme returns for which CDS are relevant.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a method that combines options and CDS to better characterise the full distribution of expected stock returns. We assess whether investors value the additional information about intermediate returns with a series of asset pricing tests.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Relative to using options only, blending options and CDS can capture important company-specific information more efficiently. Stock portfolios based on differences between options/CDS and options-only estimates of expected returns earn a substantial risk premium. We can conclude that investors value the information we unlock with our methodology.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We propose a method to extract the risk-neutral distribution of firm-specific stock returns using both options and credit default swaps (CDS). Options and CDS provide information about the central part and the left tail of the distribution, respectively. Taken together, but not in isolation, options and CDS span the intermediate part of the distribution, which is driven by exposure to the risk of large but not extreme returns. Through a series of asset-pricing tests, we show that this intermediate-return risk carries a premium, particularly at times of heightened market stress.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>China's local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) are often viewed as platforms that are used to evade borrowing constraints and make inefficient investments. They are even accused of harbouring potential fiscal and financial risks. By contrast, anecdotal evidence suggests that some LGFVs contribute to local economic growth through successful investments.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We provide new insights on LGFVs, especially in terms of how they invest. Using data for 4,432 LGFVs from 1,225 counties across China between 2005 and 2018, we show that since 2014 the function of LGFVs has changed from financing conduits to conglomerate platforms with more diversified investments. By combining LGFV-level micro data and county-level macroeconomic data, we evaluate the investment style of LGFVs and their impact on local economies in a novel way.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The degree of LGFV diversification has an inverted U-shaped relationship with local economic growth. Diversification up to a certain level accelerates growth, while over-diversified investment hinders growth. Moreover, the effect of diversification on economic growth has become much more prominent since 2014, and also depends on the condition of a local economy. The finding that some diversification is a blessing but too much is a curse might be explained by debt build-ups and the crowding-out effect on private firms.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper examines how China's local governments make investment via financing vehicles (LGFVs) and provides new insights on often-criticised LGFVs from a different perspective. Using data for 4,432 LGFVs from 1,225 counties across China between 2005 and 2018, we show that since 2014, the function of LGFVs has changed from financing conduits to conglomerate platforms with more diversified investments. While a certain level of diversification can be a blessing for local economic growth, over-diversification is a curse. Such an inverted U-shaped relationship depends on the condition of the local economy. Over-diversification may lead to rising local debt and crowding-out effects on private investment.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span>Increased lending by non-banks in the last three decades has significantly changed the US financial intermediation system. Additionally, non-banks may affect financial stability, both directly and through their linkages with the banking system. This paper asks what has driven the rapid rise of non-bank intermediation, and how these drivers relate to those for traditional bank credit. It also investigates their combined effects on the economy. </span><span> </span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span>We use an estimated DSGE model with two types of financial intermediary: banks and non-banks and subject to various economy-wide disturbances </span>–<span> such as technological progress, aggregate demand, and financial shocks </span>–<span> and sector-specific shocks that directly impact only bank or non-bank lending. The paper offers new insights into the role of macro versus financial shocks in driving economic fluctuations. By explicitly modelling two different types of financial intermediary, an important role for sectoral financial shocks is uncovered, a finding overlooked by the previous literature.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span>The paper finds a quantitatively dominant role for sectoral financial shocks in driving bank and non-bank lending growth. More than 70% of bank and non-bank lending growth is driven by sectoral shocks. Shocks to the net worth of entrepreneurs who borrow from banks and non-banks are particularly important. Historical decompositions show that shocks to the net worth of entrepreneurs are important in understanding the deep decline in bank lending growth in the early 1990s and the dynamics of bank and non-bank lending entering into the Great Recession. Together, they account for around half of the declines in bank and non-bank lending growth during those two periods.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We explore the structural drivers of bank and nonbank credit cycles using a medium-scale DSGE model with two types of financial intermediation. We posit economy-wide and sectoral disturbances in both macro and financial sectors. We estimate that sectoral shocks to the balance sheets of entrepreneurs are important for fluctuations in bank and nonbank credit growth at the business cycle frequency. Economy-wide entrepreneurial risk shocks gain predominance for explaining the lower frequency co-movement between the two series. Macro shocks play very little role in explaining financial cycles.</p>

<p>We study the dynamic properties of sovereign bonds in emerging market economies and their associated risk premiums. We focus on the interaction between credit and currency risks, ie the Twin Ds, reflected in local currency bonds issued by sovereigns in Asia-Pacific (AP).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We contribute to the literature on determinants of sovereign credit spreads by establishing evidence on how financial markets perceive and value the joint risk of sovereign default and its currency devaluation (the Twin Ds). Understanding this risk is important as credit and exchange rate risks may reinforce one another on the way towards economic and financial distress, and may therefore result in sizeable risk premiums. Local currency (LC) bonds offer an ideal source of information about the Twin Ds because international investors who take positions in such assets are exposed to both credit and exchange rate risks. In modelling these risks, we allow for two "global" anchors – US and Chinese – to potentially affect local AP factors and LC bond prices.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Relying on the term structure of LC bonds issued by Asia-Pacific sovereigns, we find strong interaction between credit and currency risks. The risk premium for this interaction is economically comparable to interest rate and credit risks. Moreover, we find that local variables are significant in the dynamics of currency and credit risk, and in the components of bond risk premiums that reflect these risks. The risk-return trade-off from exposure to the Twin Ds risk is attractive, as investing in LC debt more than doubles the maximum Sharpe ratio compared with investment in global (US and Chinese) bonds only.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Trade tensions between China and the United States have created volatility in the global stock market in recent years, but their effects are difficult to quantify. News items related to tariffs and other factors, including trade barriers between the two countries, have made the analysis of these effects particularly challenging. For this reason, the literature has thus far mainly analysed case studies that refer to specific episodes with a time horizon of just a few days.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we introduce a new trade sentiment index (TSI) that captures, in a more continuous fashion, the tone regarding trade in Chinese media, and examine its ability to explain the behaviour of global stock markets. Second, we analyse the effects of the China-US trade sentiment on stock market prices at the country, sectoral and firm level during the period January 2018–June 2019. Third, we disentangle the stock market effects of trade sentiment deriving from social media (ie media articles on the web, forums and multi-purpose social media platform WeChat) from those from traditional media (ie newspapers and magazines).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>No equity market benefits from worsening China-US trade sentiment, and Asian markets tend to be more negatively affected. In particular, we find that sectors most affected by tariffs – such as those related to information technology – are particularly sensitive to the tone in trade tension. The TSI accounts for about 10% of the model's capacity to explain stock price movements in countries significantly exposed to the China-US value chain, with social media accounting for the majority of the sentiment (9%) and traditional media only modestly (1%).</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Trade tensions between China and US have played an important role in swinging global stock markets but effects are difficult to quantify. We develop a novel trade sentiment index (TSI) based on textual analysis and machine learning applied on a big data pool that assesses the positive or negative tone of the Chinese media coverage, and evaluates its capacity to explain the behaviour of 60 global equity markets. We find the TSI to contribute around 10% of model capacity to explain the stock price variability from January 2018 to June 2019 in countries that are more exposed to the China-US value chain. Most of the contribution is given by the tone extracted from social media (9%), while that obtained from traditional media explains only a modest part of stock price variability (1%). No equity market benefits from the China-US trade war, and Asian markets tend to be more negatively affected. In particular, we find that sectors most affected by tariffs such as information technology related ones are particularly sensitive to the tone in trade tension.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>After a new technology becomes available, firms learn about its productivity by undertaking small-scale test projects. Based on accounting rules, the corresponding costs are booked as research and development (R&amp;D). A company may invest too little in learning about a new technology, for instance when its competitors can observe the outcome of its test projects. In aggregate, firms risk gaining insufficient insights into a technology before deciding whether to adopt it or not.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study whether investor sentiment, often defined as the propensity to speculate in financial markets, can lead firms to increase R&amp;D after a new technology becomes available. In particular, we are interested in whether the effect of investor sentiment is stronger for companies that are more likely to face constraints that reduce investment in test projects.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that investor sentiment reinforces the effect of lagged technological innovation on company R&amp;D, especially in two cases. The first is when a firm's test projects can inform its competitors about the value of the new technology. The second is when a firm's shareholders have short investment horizons. Overall, investor sentiment appears to offset, at least in part, constraints that can diminish a company's incentives to learn about a new technology.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Following periods of intense technological innovation, R&amp;D is a critical driver of technology diffusion, but it is subject to frictions that can lower it below the level firms would undertake otherwise. We study whether sentiment can counterbalance these frictions and thus strengthen the link between firm-level R&amp;D and lagged aggregate innovation. We find a positive answer for low-tech firms, which represent the main conduit for technology diffusion. The effect is stronger in the presence of informational externalities, that is when the results of experimentation funded by a company are observable by competitors. In contrast to the literature on sentiment and capital expenditures, the effect is weaker for financially constrained firms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper aims to assess the level of integration of the European emerging countries in the global economy by analysing inflation dynamics across the region. Starting in 2014, the inflation rate in the European emerging countries declined consistently, in line with global developments, even if strong economic growth and tight labour markets in the region would have been expected to fuel local inflationary pressures.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper contributes to the literature on inflation globalisation by focusing on the European emerging countries. Given the high complexity of the globalisation process, the study considers both the short- and the longer-term implications, and covers different measures of price changes in the economy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results show that global factors, such as the euro area inflation rate and the output gap in the euro area, guided the inflation rate in the European emerging countries below the levels warranted by local fundamentals. Consumer prices and industry producer costs are strongly synchronised with global factors. However, price changes in the service sector and those of the less volatile items in the household consumption basket posted lower correlation with international developments.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies inflation globalisation in the European emerging countries by measuring inflation co-movement across the region and assessing how local inflation rates reacted to global factors. The analysis covers central and eastern European countries which are members of the European Union but do not currently belong to the euro area. The results confirm sizeable inflation co-movement and a significant influence exerted by global factors on the inflation rate in emerging Europe. The euro area inflation rate and the output gap in the euro area are the external factors with the strongest impact, thereby underlining the strong ties of the region with the single currency area. The sensitivity of the consumer price (CPI) inflation rate in the region to global price dynamics firmly increased after 2014, whereas the alignment of producer price inflation with international inflation developments occurred even earlier, after the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, core CPI inflation and GDP deflator inflation were less correlated with the corresponding global inflation indicators, emphasising the still prominent role of domestic factors in driving price changes in the region.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In the past decade, population ageing and the rising number of single-person households have transformed demographic structures worldwide. However, the impact of such changes on house prices is still only imperfectly understood. We investigate the relationship between house prices and demographic changes and its significance for macroprudential policies, focusing on Korea, a country facing exceptionally rapid demographic shifts.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We test how various demographic factors affect house price growth at the disaggregated level in Korea from the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our data set has unique features, including a variety of house price indexes based on property types, quantified loan-to-value and debt-to-income limits, and other demographic factors at the district level. Specifically, we attempt to shed light on how the elderly population and single-person households, together with their response to macroprudential policies, affect house prices.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, high elderly dependency ratios, unlike youth dependency ratios, lead to house price increases. Contrary to the life-cycle and asset meltdown hypotheses, this evidence suggests that ageing may not cause house prices to drop. This is probably because the elderly tend to own houses even after their retirement because of their increased life expectancy, thanks to improved public health.  </p>
<p>Second, house price growth is weaker in districts with a high proportion of single-person households, which appears to be associated with their lower income or delayed family formation.</p>
<p>Third, macroprudential policies are not a channel through which elderly and single-person households affect house prices. At the same time, these policies generally work as expected, so that loosening policy tends to increase house price growth. One possible reason is that elderly and single-person households are not eligible for loans due to their lower incomes.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates how recent demographic changes – population aging and the rising number of single-person households – affect house price growth using 95 district-level data in Korea from Q1 2008 to Q4 2017. Based on a unique data set that includes quantified macroprudential policy variables and various house price indices from real transaction data, our analyses yield three key findings. First, house price growth increases in districts with high aged dependency ratios, suggesting that aging is unlikely to drive house prices downward. Second, house price growth falls in districts with a high proportion of single-person households, possibly due to their low level of income or delayed family formation. Third, macroprudential policies are generally effective, but not for the elderly and single-person households. Overall, the evidence suggests that demographic shifts are an essential factor for determining house prices.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>To align banks' loss-absorbing resources with actual risks, new regulation features forward-looking elements. Namely, recently adopted provisioning standards seek to align the amount of assets that banks write down with the level of expected future losses (EL), which may vary over time. In parallel, capital requirements are set to generate resources for time-varying unexpected losses (UL), or the extent to which EL may be exceeded in extreme scenarios.</p>
<p>Even though EL and UL are complementary aspects of the same loss distribution, the literature has studied them separately. It has been largely pessimistic about the feasibility of reliable forecasts that flag turning points of EL in advance. And existing UL forecasts are only indirect, stemming from early warning indictors of banking crises.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We extend the model behind the Basel III requirements for credit risk in order to study forecasts of a loss distribution that transitions between boom and bust phases. While improved forecasts of the phase-switching risk factor should lead to adjustments to both EL and UL forecasts, the degree of diversification in the portfolio determines whether these adjustments should be in the same or opposite directions. In addition, forecasting either EL or UL carries information about the other aspect of the loss distribution.</p>
<p>This leads us to develop an empirical framework for forecasting EL and UL jointly and in real time ("out of sample"). On the basis of variables from the loss-rate literature and traditional financial-cycle indicators, we forecast the mean and variance of loan-portfolio losses over individual quarters, up to three years in the future. Then we develop and apply a methodology for aggregating these forecasts across quarters in order to construct EL and UL over the portfolio's lifetime. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first real-time UL forecasts. Finally, we assess alternative results that stem from different forecast variables and econometric specifications.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We apply our methodology to US data on quarterly loan-loss rates from 1985 to 2019, confirming that there are benefits from forecasting EL and UL jointly. We find that financial-cycle indicators – notably the debt service-to-income ratio and the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its real-time trend – deliver reliable forecasts, as they signal turning points up to three years in advance. Given this long lead, provisions and capital that reflect such forecasts would help reduce the procyclicality of banks' loss-absorbing resources.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Extending a standard credit-risk model illustrates that a single factor can drive both expected losses and the extent to which they may be exceeded in extreme scenarios, ie "unexpected losses." This leads us to develop a framework for forecasting these losses jointly. In an application to quarterly US data on loan charge-offs from 1985 to 2019, we find that financial-cycle indicators – notably, the debt service ratio and credit-to-GDP gap – deliver reliable real-time forecasts, signalling turning points up to three years in advance. Provisions and capital that reflect such forecasts would help reduce the procyclicality of banks' loss-absorbing resources.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When interest rates decline, banks tend to chase yield by issuing risker loans. Yet the degree to which banks do this varies considerably. What explains the differences across banks? One possible explanation relates to differences in regulatory and market capital. Regulatory capital gauges how close a bank is to breaching the regulatory capital threshold. Market-based capital measures how much "skin in the game" a bank's shareholders have. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We first show that regulatory capital and market capital differ substantially over time and across banks. We then use syndicated loan data to examine if and how each of the two capital measures affects the impact of monetary policy on banks' risk-taking.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that low US interest rates spur the origination of risky US dollar international loans through two mechanisms. First, consistent with the existence of a "regulatory capital channel", banks with higher levels of regulatory capital are more likely to originate riskier loans when interest rates decline. Second, banks with low levels of market capital have a greater propensity to extend riskier loans in response to falling interest rates. This finding implies the existence of a market capital channel, which operates in the opposite direction to the regulatory capital channel.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate the links among US monetary policy, bank capital, and risk taking in international bank lending. Using syndicated loan data, we find that low US interest rates spur the origination of risky dollar-denominated international loans through two distinct mechanisms. First, consistent with the existence of a regulatory capital channel, banks with higher levels of regulatory capital originate riskier loans when interest rates decline. Second, banks with low levels of market capital have a higher propensity to extend riskier loans in response to falling interest rates. This finding implies the existence of a market capital channel, which operates in the opposite direction to the regulatory capital channel.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Over the past decades, the South ("Sur") has become ever more important compared with the North – countries including Canada, Japan, the United States and those in Western Europe. It is well known that the South accounts for a growing share of global economic activity and international trade. The role of the South in global finance, however, remains less explored.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper studies international investments from and to the South, and compares them with those from and to the North. We combine various types of investments, covering bank loans and deposits, portfolio investment, foreign direct investment and international reserves. Most prior work looks at how countries invest in the rest of the world. We collected bilateral data, which reveal the sources and destinations of international investment. This sheds new light on how groups of countries integrate with one another.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper documents the rise of the South in global finance. International investments between the North and South expanded faster than within the North. Financial integration within the South has grown even faster. By 2018, the South accounted for 24 to 40% of international loans and deposits, portfolio investment and foreign direct investment. This is about 10 percentage points more than in 2001. These trends not only appear in the value of investment, but also in the spread of new links between countries. Our findings hold across many country pairs – ie they are not due to only a few large countries in the South. They also continue to hold when we incorporate offshore financial centers into the analysis.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using country-to-country data, this paper documents a set of novel stylized facts about the rise of the South in global finance. The paper assembles comprehensive bilateral data on cross-border bank loans and deposits, portfolio investment in debt and equity, foreign direct investment, and international reserves. The main finding is that global financial integration with and especially within the South (countries outside the G7 and Western Europe) has grown faster than within the North. By 2018, the South accounted for 24 to 40 percent of international loans and deposits, portfolio investment, and foreign direct investment, an increase of roughly 10 percentage points since 2001. The growing importance of the South is reflected in the intensive and extensive margins, with fast growth in the number of bilateral links. Although China weighs heavily in these trends, international investment in the rest of the South has increased to a similar extent.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the most severe contraction in global economic activity in post-WWII history. Strikingly, countries with a steeper predicted GDP decline in 2020 also have seen a higher number of deaths in excess of Covid-19-related fatalities, especially among emerging market economies (EMEs). As a possible explanation for the pattern, this paper investigates the link between recessions and mortality using historical data covering 180 countries over six decades.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In analysing the link between recessions and mortality, this paper covers an aspect of the pandemic that has so far been missing in the public debate: if a recession-mortality nexus exists, then the apparent trade-off between saving lives from the pandemic and sacrificing incomes in virus containment policies could be more complex. By exploring the issue for a large number of advanced economies (AEs) and EMEs, the paper also contributes to the literature on the health effects of economic fluctuations, which has so far mainly focused on the richest economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We find that recessions are associated with a sizeable and highly significant increase in mortality. Specifically, recessions increase mortality rates primarily in EMEs – and within EMEs, child mortality rates in particular. We further find that the deeper the recession, the larger the increase in mortality rates among EMEs. Importantly, recessions cast a long shadow: they lead to significantly higher death rates for up to 10 years and higher child mortality rates for up to 12 years. Our results imply that the death toll of the pandemic probably exceeds that directly attributable to the disease. Given the recession-mortality nexus, lockdown policies may be more effective in reducing mortality rates if they consider their direct economic consequences. Finally, monetary and fiscal policy measures mitigating the length or depth of the recession may also reduce mortality.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using panel data covering 180 countries over six decades, this paper shows that recessions are systematically associated with higher mortality rates. During years when GDP falls, death rates rise, primarily in emerging market and developing economies and there among children in particular. In advanced economies, death rates increase only slightly. We further nd that the scarring effects of recessions persist for several years and that deeper recessions lead to larger increases in mortality. In contrast, booms or periods of subdued growth are not associated with a marked decline in death rates. Our ndings have implications for the policy response to Covid-19 and suggest that the eventual death toll of the pandemic may be understated if the impact of the coronavirus recession is neglected.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Bank distress episodes tend to be followed by recessions, whose severity varies significantly across episodes. There are two interrelated sets of explanations for such variation. One relates to the initial economic conditions, notably the macro-financial imbalances with which countries enter distress. Another relates to the policies deployed. These choices probably influence the severity of the recession. Yet we know little about the effectiveness of the various policies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We present a new database that tracks policy interventions (such as central bank lending, asset purchases, bank liability guarantees and impaired asset segregation schemes) in 29 countries between 1980 and 2016. We then propose a methodology to classify and compare bank distress episodes based on their initial macro-financial conditions. Finally, we assess whether differences in policies can explain the observed variations in GDP growth across comparable episodes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Policy interventions help restore GDP growth and normalise the economy when bank distress follows a period of high cross-border exposures. Central bank lending and asset purchase schemes are effective in the first and second years of distress, respectively, and when bank distress follows low asset valuations, high bank leverage and weak bank performance. Overall, our results suggest that swift and broad-ranging policies can lessen the adverse economic effect of bank distress.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the effectiveness of policy tools that deal with bank distress (i.e. central bank lending, asset purchases, bank liability guarantees, impaired asset segregation schemes). We present and draw on a novel database that tracks the use of such tools in 29 countries between 1980 and 2016. To keep "all else" equal, we test whether different policies explain differences in how countries fared through bank distress episodes that feature observationally similar initial macro–financial vulnerabilities. We find that, altogether, policy interventions help restore GDP growth and normalize the economy when bank distress follows a period of high cross–border exposures. Central bank lending and asset purchase schemes are especially effective in the first and second years of distress, respectively, and when bank distress follows low asset valuations, high bank leverage and weak bank performance. Overall, our results suggest that swift and broad–ranging policies can mitigate the adverse economic effects of bank distress.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Banking sector interconnectedness and contagion materialize in more than one way. The most obvious is the direct exposures between banks. However, the fate of seemingly disconnected and geographically dispersed institutions can still be bound together due to the importance of indirect contagion. Most important within such interconnections are exposures to the same assets and to externalities driven by fire sales. The importance of each contagion channel remains a contested issue and is ultimately an empirical question.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We provide a simple and tractable accounting-based stress-testing framework to assess loss dynamics in a banking sector connected via direct interbank exposures and common asset holdings (ie overlapping portfolios). We develop measures that allow for the computation of losses stemming from network exposures, as well as additional losses generated by fire sale dynamics. In this way, we can account for the contribution to system losses of each contagion channel. We apply our framework to detailed micro-financial euro area data.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We find that interbank exposures account for only a minor share of the overall losses due to contagion. Aside from the direct effect of shocks to the value of assets on the trading book, common exposures that make banks vulnerable to fire sales and synchronous price dislocations account for the bulk of distress contagion. The calibration of the price impact of fire sales is a critical input to determine the extent of losses. Stress-testing exercises would greatly benefit from more efforts to improve such calibrations.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We provide a simple and tractable accounting-based stress-testing framework to assess loss dynamics in the banking sector, in a context of leverage targeting. Contagion can occur through direct interbank exposures, and indirect exposures due to overlapping portfolios with the associated price dynamics via fire sales. We apply the framework to three granular proprietary ECB datasets, including an interbank network of 26 large euro area banks as well as their overlapping portfolios of loans, derivatives and securities. A 5 percent shock to the price of assets held in the trading book leads to an initial loss of 30 percent of system equity and an additional loss of 1.3 percent due to fire sales spillovers. Direct interbank contagion is negligible in our analysis. Our findings underscore the importance of accurately estimating the price effects of fire sales.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When bank stock prices are low, relative to book value, banks have a stronger incentive to pay out dividends. But paying dividends reduces banks' capacity to lend and weakens their resilience to shocks. In response to the Covid-19 crisis, regulators and banking federations have set or recommended rules that banks should stop their dividend payouts or share buybacks in order to conserve their capital.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper asks what factors underlie a bank's decision to pay out a dividend. In particular, we look at the relationship between a bank's price-to-book ratio and the likelihood that it will pay a dividend. We study a large group of advanced economy banks, using a sample that runs from the Great Financial Crisis up to the present Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that a bank's propensity to pay dividends depends on its price-to-book ratio, albeit in a non-linear way. The lower the price-to-book ratio, the greater is a bank's propensity to pay dividends. And this negative relationship steepens when the price-to-book ratio falls below 0.7, a result that is robust to several checks. We also show that a bank's propensity to pay a dividend correlates positively with its size and short-run profitability, but not with annual changes in its total assets.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical exercise with fixed balance sheet ratios, we find that if the banks in our sample had completely stopped paying out dividends during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, they would have boosted their lending capacity by an additional $0.8–1.1 trillion, depending on the stress scenario. This is equivalent to 1.1–1.6% of total GDP.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Banks with a low price-to-book ratio have a greater propensity to pay out dividends. This propensity is especially marked for banks with a price-to-book ratio below a threshold of 0.7. As a sector, banks also tend to have higher dividend payout ratios than non-financial firms. We demonstrate these features using data for 271 advanced economy banks in 30 jurisdictions. Dividend payouts as a proportion of profits rise in a non-linear way as the price-to-book ratio falls below 0.7. In a hypothetical exercise with fixed balance sheet ratios, we find that a complete suspension of bank dividends in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic would have added, under different stress scenario, an additional US$ 0.8–1.1 trillion of bank lending capacity in our sample, equivalent to 1.1–1.6% of total GDP.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Gold investments still form a significant share of central banks and governments' FX reserve portfolios. We ask whether this high share is justified from a risk-return standpoint, while investigating the variety of factors that make this a difficult question.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We make three contributions. First, we focus on how gold affects portfolios formed purely of fixed income assets, as these more closely resemble those managed by central banks and governments in practice. Second, we analyse a broad range of risk-return measures, over and above the typically applied mean-variance framework. Third, we go beyond the discussion of what is optimal for portfolios on average (as commonly seen in the literature) to focus on what might be optimal in extreme cases, ie at the tail of the risk distribution. This is of great interest to reserve managers.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">From a market risk perspective, a low-duration, reserve currency fixed income portfolio may benefit only from very small gold allocations (between 0% and 5%), on average. Nonetheless, sizeable gold holdings may be justified, from a purely quantitative standpoint, for portfolios with a higher duration and for reserve managers who measure their returns in a non-reserve currency. In addition, when looking at the benefits of gold as a protection against an extreme event, we find that high allocations (of between 20% and 50%) may be adequate in some cases. Our results suggest that choosing an appropriate share for gold in reserve portfolios is a complex task. The answer depends crucially on both the purpose (policy objectives) and implementation (numéraire, risk tolerance etc) of the reserve management process.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Almost five decades after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, gold continues to form an important share of global foreign exchange reserves. This may be because gold has traditionally offered reserve managers many benefits, such as the absence of default risk. This paper explores whether these large investment shares in gold are also justified from a risk-return standpoint, or whether any other explanations have to be brought to bear. To do this, we go beyond the simple application of portfolio optimisation techniques, comprehensively analysing all possible long-only combinations of gold and representative fixed income reserve portfolios. We conclude that the market risk associated with gold is substantial when evaluated against a broad range of criteria, such as mitigating portfolio volatility, tail-risk, the probability of loss, and measures of diversification. This will tend to limit overall allocations. Nonetheless, for portfolios with higher sensitivity to interest rates (duration) and for reserve managers who measure their returns in a non-reserve currency, we find evidence that gold may function as a hedge, making it easier to justify sizeable gold holdings from a purely quantitative perspective.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Both the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and rapid advances in traditional centralised systems are moving the technological horizon of money and payments. These trends are embodied in private "stablecoins": cryptocurrencies with values tied to fiat currencies or other assets. This paper looks at market developments, how they might be monitored, the potential role of stablecoins and what this implies for their regulation.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We sketch market developments for existing stablecoins and describe their potential for embedding a robust monetary instrument into digital environments. We then assess "global stablecoin" proposals, including Facebook's revised Libra 2.0 project. We discuss potential regulatory responses, including focusing on the necessity of a balanced proportional approach. Stablecoins raise the option to embed supervisory requirements into stablecoin systems themselves, allowing for "embedded supervision". We conclude with a discussion of whether central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or other initiatives could provide more effective solutions to fulfil the functions that stablecoins are seeking to address.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show a dichotomy between existing stablecoins and planned global stablecoins. Existing stablecoins aim to serve as a means of settlement for automated financial products, offering the possibility of so-called "smart" contracts, ie self-executing code. Global stablecoin proposals like Libra claim that they will make possible new forms of online exchange through their 24/7 availability, borderless nature, fractionalisation and integration with non-financial services. In this light, they aim to challenge existing digital means of payment for e-commerce like traditional bank payments, credit cards and electronic wallets.</p>
<p>We argue that the regulatory responses to global stablecoins should take into account this difference. The response to global stablecoins should address the potential for other stablecoin uses, such as embedding a robust monetary instrument into digital environments, especially in the context of decentralised systems. Looking forward, in such cases, stablecoins may allow for embedded supervision. At the same time, we suggest that many of these benefits may be achieved - and arguably more effectively in many cases - with CBDCs and other initiatives such as fast payment systems.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The technologies underlying money and payment systems are evolving rapidly. Both the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and rapid advances in traditional centralised systems are moving the technological horizon of money and payments. These trends are embodied in private "stablecoins": cryptocurrencies with values tied to fiat currencies or other assets. Stablecoins - in particular potential "global stablecoins" such as Facebook's Libra proposal - pose a range of challenges from the standpoint of financial authorities around the world. At the same time, regulatory responses to global stablecoins should take into account the potential of other stablecoin uses, such as embedding a robust monetary instrument into digital environments, especially in the context of decentralised systems. Looking forward, in such cases, one possible option from a regulatory standpoint is to embed supervisory requirements into stablecoin systems themselves, allowing for "embedded supervision".

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Understanding the effects of house price booms on firm behaviour and the aggregate economy is a key concern for policy makers. On the one hand, rising real estate values relax firms' financial constraints, which could lead to economic expansion and higher efficiency. However, recent studies show that house price booms can depress productivity. So far, we lack empirical evidence on the channels through which house prices affect aggregate productivity.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper investigates how rising house prices affect firms' collateral values, and thereby the reallocation of capital and labour across firms and aggregate productivity. I further discuss the potential role of low interest rates in the interaction of these forces. Since interest rates are a key driver of real estate prices, a "low-for-long" interest environment could have unintended consequences for productivity. By inflating house prices low interest rates could lead to a reallocation of resources across firms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Rising real estate prices lead to a reallocation of capital and labour towards unproductive firms and thereby depress industry productivity. I first establish that listed US firms that hold real estate are persistently less productive than non-holders. Rising real estate values hence relax collateral constraints for inefficient firms, which allows them to expand production. The ensuing reallocation of resources towards low-productivity firms has negative consequences for aggregate industry productivity: industries with a stronger relative increase in real estate values see a significant decline in total factor productivity, and the within-industry covariance between firm size and productivity declines.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>I establish that US public firms holding real estate have persistently lower levels of productivity than non-holders. Rising real estate values relax collateral constraints for companies that own real estate and allow them to expand production. Consequently, an increase in house prices reallocates capital and labor towards inefficient firms, with negative consequences for aggregate industry productivity. Industries with a stronger relative increase in real estate values see a significant decline in total factor productivity, and the within-industry covariance between firm size and productivity declines. My results suggest a novel channel through which real estate booms affect productivity and have implications for monetary policy.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The relationship between inflation and economic activity has apparently weakened in recent years. We ask how trends in workers' bargaining power may have played a role.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a general equilibrium model to show that, when workers' bargaining power weakens, firms to react to lower demand by cutting the number of workers (extensive margin) rather than reducing the hours per employee (intensive margin). Since the marginal cost increases with hours per employee, this affects production costs and hence inflation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Using aggregate data for the euro area, we confirm that the decline in workers' bargaining power has weakened the relationship between inflation and economic activity. Our findings gain support from a survey of Italian industrial firms, which shows that the more unionised firms tend to cut working hours per employee (ie adjust the intensive margin of labour) to a greater extent when demand falls.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use a general equilibrium model to show that a decrease in workers' bargaining power amplifies the relative contribution to the output gap of adjustments along the extensive margin of labour utilization. This mechanism reduces the cyclical movements of marginal cost (and inflation) relative to those of the output gap. We show that the relationship between bargaining power and adjustments along the extensive margin (relative to the intensive margin) is supported by microdata. Our analysis relies on panel data from the Italian survey of industrial firms. The Bayesian estimation of the model using euro-area aggregate data covering the 1970-1990 and 1991-2016 samples confirms that the decline in workers' bargaining power has weakened the inflation-output gap relationship.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Trust is the bedrock of a sound monetary system. This paper examines the rise and fall of the Bank of Amsterdam (1609-1820) to gain insights on the central bank underpinnings of money. It sheds light on the governance of digital currencies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper draws lessons from the Bank of Amsterdam for the governance of money. The early operational framework of the Bank of Amsterdam resembled a "stablecoin" - where account-based money is backed by assets of stable value and where the money stock is managed passively by the inflows and outflows of assets. Over time, the Bank began to use its balance sheet in a more elastic manner, and to take on some functions of a central bank, including lending activity through overdrafts. In the 1780s, the Bank's lending activity grew excessive, and led ultimately to its downfall.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Empirical analysis with monthly balance sheet data shows that confidence in Bank of Amsterdam money as reflected in the premium over metal coins was eroded as the share of loans in the Bank's assets increased. While short-term fluctuations in lending had little impact on confidence in Bank money, the relationship reasserted itself in the medium run.</p>
<p>The Bank of Amsterdam and its rise and fall provide many useful lessons, but two resonate particularly loudly for current debates on the nature of the money and the role of the central bank. First, rigid stablecoins are poorly suited as the foundation for a modern monetary system. Second, for a central bank to play its role, the fiscal backing of the sovereign and its fiscal sustainability are essential.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper draws lessons on the central bank underpinnings of money from the rise and fall of the Bank of Amsterdam (1609-1820). The Bank started out as a "stablecoin": it issued deposits backed by silver and gold coins, and settled payments by transfers across deposits. Over time, it performed functions of a modern central bank and its deposits took on attributes of fiat money. The economic shocks of the 1780s, large-scale lending and lack of fiscal support led to its failure. Using monthly balance sheet data, we show how confidence in Bank money gave way to a run equilibrium, where the fall of the premium on deposits over coins ("agio") into negative territory was swift and precipitous. This holds lessons for the governance of digital money.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The rise of fintechs promises to spur competition in the financial sector. This could lead to sizeable efficiency gains, more choice for consumers, and enhanced financial inclusion. However, the potentially disruptive growth of firms offering novel products and services poses new challenges for financial stability and consumer protection. In response, policymakers around the world are creating "regulatory sandboxes" to foster innovation in the financial sector while keeping alert to emerging risks. One key objective of sandboxes is to facilitate start-ups' access to capital. The UK Financial Conduct Authority pioneered the world's first regulatory sandbox in 2015. To date, more than 50 countries have adopted sandboxes, but little evidence exists on whether they actually help innovative fintechs raise funding. And if so, why/how.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper analyses how entering the United Kingdom's regulatory sandbox affects fintechs' ability to raise funding. We collect unique data on capital raised by UK fintechs between 2014 and 2019. Our sample covers fintechs that joined the sandbox, as well as a large group of comparable control firms that did not join the sandbox. Further, detailed data broken down by individual investor, as well as background information on firm characteristics, allow us to investigate different channels through which the entry in the sandbox could affect firms' access to capital. Our paper contributes to the current debate on public policies to foster innovation and competition in the financial sector. Sandboxes could provide regulators with an effective tool to gauge the various implications of innovations at an early stage of their development. An assessment of their effectiveness and an understanding of the channels through which sandboxes operate is hence indispensable.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Entry into the sandbox is associated with a higher probability of raising funding and an increase of about 15% in the average amount of funding raised. Our evidence suggests that regulatory sandboxes improve access to funding by reducing information asymmetries and regulatory costs for three reasons. First, the positive effect of sandbox entry on capital raised is particularly pronounced for smaller and younger firms, which are usually subject to more severe informational frictions. Second, sandbox entry is followed by an increase in first-time investors and in the share of investors that are based outside the United Kingdom. These investors are likely to face greater information asymmetries due to either geographical distance or a lack of previous relationships. Finally, we find that firms with a CEO who has a personal background in financial law benefit less from sandbox entry. This is in line with anecdotal evidence that CEOs without prior experience in financial regulation benefit more from the guidance provided by case officers during the process of obtaining authorisation.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Policymakers around the world are adopting regulatory sandboxes as a tool for spurring innovation in the financial sector while keeping alert to emerging risks. Using unique data for the UK, this paper provides initial evidence on the effectiveness of the world's first sandbox in improving fintechs' access to finance. Firms entering the sandbox see a significant increase of 15% in capital raised post-entry, relative to firms that did not enter; and their probability of raising capital increases by 50%. Our results furthermore suggest that the sandbox facilitates access to capital through two channels: reduced asymmetric information and reduced regulatory costs or uncertainty. Our results are confirmed when we exploit the staggered introduction of the sandbox and compare firms in earlier to those in later sandbox cohorts, and when we compare participating firms to a matched set of firms that never enters the sandbox.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We ask whether commercial property markets affect bank equity prices. For this purpose, we use the prices of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a proxy for the performance of commercial property markets. Our study is based on data from the euro area, Japan and the United States, focusing on the 2003-20 period. The study includes the effects of the Great Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We test the hypothesis that REIT prices affect bank equity prices, particularly during downturns. We have three reasons to consider this hypothesis valid. First, banks are exposed to commercial property. Second, REIT prices are likely to reflect commercial property valuations more promptly than publicly disclosed financial information. Third, as lenders, banks are more exposed to the downside than to the upside of real estate risk.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that, first, REIT prices can predict bank equity prices a month ahead. Second, we show that the "commercial property factor" adds value to standard bank equity pricing models. Third, the commercial property factor works particularly strongly during a crisis. This factor explains roughly half of the fall in average bank equity prices during the Great Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that REIT prices can usefully complement supervisory monitoring.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We test whether commercial property performance, proxied by real estate investment trust (REIT) prices, can inform us about bank equity prices. Using data from the United States, the euro area and Japan, we show that REIT prices can predict bank equity prices. Furthermore, a "commercial property factor" adds significant explanatory power to both the CAPM and the 3-factor Fama-French model. At the same time, quantile regressions show that this factor becomes particularly prominent during downturns. It accounts for around half of the drop in average bank valuations during the great financial crisis and, again, during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Policy-makers and practitioners tend to see capital inflows to emerging market economies (EMEs) as expansionary, as they ease domestic financial conditions and boost credit and domestic demand. This, coupled with their volatility, implies that capital flows to EMEs are also a source of vulnerability capable of generating boom-bust cycles. Capital controls and macroprudential policies thus emerge as relevant policy tools to manage associated risks.  However, the causal effect of capital inflows on EME macro-financial conditions is hard to pin down empirically and should be key to well-informed policy design.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>International bank lending is an important component of capital flows, as emphasized by the growing literature on the role of global banks in transmitting financial conditions across borders. We assess the causal effect of international bank lending on key financial and real variables for a sample of 22 EMEs over 1990Q1-2018Q4, using BIS data. To identify causal effects, we rely on the intuitive observation that, as international bank lending is concentrated, lenders that account for high shares of lending to a given EME will affect aggregate international lending to this country and, through it, aggregate macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that cross-border bank credit causes higher domestic activity in EMEs through looser financial conditions.   Financial condition indices ease, nominal and real effective exchange rates appreciate, sovereign and corporate spreads narrow, domestic interest rates fall, and housing prices rise.  As a result, economic activity as well as domestic credit growth also pick up. The effects are weaker for countries that have higher degrees of capital inflow controls. In other words, controls on capital inflows can help EMEs cushion the effects of international bank lending shocks (eg moderate a boom in financial conditions, or limit the growth of credit).</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Banking flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) are a potential source of vulnerability capable of generating boom-bust cycles. The causal effect of such inflows on EME macro-financial conditions is hard to pin down empirically and should be key to well-informed policy design. We provide novel empirical evidence on the effects of cross-border bank lending on EMEs macro-financial conditions. We identify causal effects by leveraging the heterogeneity in the size distribution of bilateral cross-border bank lending to construct granular instrumental variables for aggregate cross-border bank lending to 22 EMEs. We find that cross-border bank credit causes higher domestic activity in EMEs through looser financial conditions. Financial condition indices ease, nominal and real effective exchange rates appreciate, sovereign and corporate spreads narrow, and domestic interest rates fall. At the same time, real domestic credit grows, real GDP expands, imports rise, and housing prices increase as well. Eects are weaker for countries with relatively higher levels of capital inflow controls, supporting the view that these policy measures can be effective in dampening the vulnerabilities associated with external funding shocks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Covid recession has had profoundly uneven effects at an industry level. Although some industries have recovered quickly since the middle of the year, customer service industries could face ongoing constraints until a vaccine or effective treatment for the virus becomes widely available. The quantitative implications of these constraints for other industries and for aggregate GDP are uncertain.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>I use a multi-industry macroeconomic model to estimate the aggregate and industry-specific disturbances that explain economic activity in a number of large economies during the Covid recession. I then use the model to forecast the recovery under various assumptions about how these disturbances evolve. I model the Covid crisis as a sequence of structural changes, meaning that I account for the effects of the crisis on the steady state of these economies, as well as the dynamic relationships between economic variables.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The output of customer service industries in large advanced economies, like the United States and the euro area, could remain 10% below its pre-Covid trend until constraints on these industries ease. These economies could face a '98% economy' in the years ahead, with output returning to at best 2% below its pre-crisis trend. At an industry level, the model's projections for Chinese economy are qualitatively similar to those of the advanced economies, although aggregate GDP in China is projected to return close to its pre-Covid trend more quickly.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The Covid crisis prompted an unprecedented global economic contraction. Although the worst is likely behind us, the recovery is likely to be uneven, with economic activity in many customer-facing service industries set to remain constrained for some time. I use a quantitative multi-industry model to estimate the economic forces that explain the decline in economic activity in the United States, the Euro Area, Japan and China in the first half of 2020. I then use the model to project the trajectory of the economic recovery. I find that the US, EA and Japan will each face a '98% economy' if half of the constraints faced by customer-facing service industries in the first half of 2020 persist. The economic recovery in China is projected to occur more quickly.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>House prices co-move across countries, sometimes more sometimes less. We ask what US dollar funding conditions and the international banking network have to do with this co-movement.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We make three contributions. First, we establish that net capital flows to the US indicate how easy it is for non-US global banks to obtain dollar funding. Second, we illustrate that foreign lending of these banks varies with their exposure to dollar funding conditions - a concept we call dollar dependence. We construct this novel empirical measure of dollar dependence by combining granular data from the BIS consolidated and locational international banking statistics. Third, we show that the effect of dollar funding conditions on house price co-movement increases in what we call dollar co-dependence, defined as the extent to which two borrowing countries jointly rely on dollar-dependent creditors.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>As more capital flows (on net) into the US from the rest of the world, it becomes easier for non-US global banks to borrow US dollars. Non-US global banks tend to finance a lot of their foreign lending in US dollars. Improved dollar funding conditions therefore drive these banks' foreign lending to third-party borrowing countries. Much of the foreign lending is allocated to mortgage markets in borrowing countries, driving house prices. Hence, as dollar funding conditions vary over time, housing markets in borrowing countries co-move more strongly.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>US net capital inflows drive the international synchronization of house price growth. An increase (decrease) in US net capital inflows improves (tightens) US dollar funding conditions for non-US global banks, leading them to increase (decrease) foreign lending to third-party borrowing countries. This induces a synchronization of lending across borrowing countries, which translates into an international synchronization of mortgage credit growth and, ultimately, house price growth. Importantly, this synchronization is driven by non-US global banks' common but heterogenous exposure to US dollar funding conditions, not by the common exposure of borrowing countries to non-US global banks. Our results identify a novel channel of international transmission of US dollar funding conditions: As these conditions vary over time, borrowing country pairs whose non-US global creditor banks are more dependent on US dollar funding exhibit higher house price synchronization.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Inflation has remained remarkably stable in many economies since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). The fact that inflation did not fall as much as might have been expected given the high degree of economic slack during the crisis or rise much in the recovery afterwards has raised questions about what contributed to the recent stability of inflation and whether the slope of the Phillips curve has flattened. This paper empirically investigates possible structural changes in the driving forces of inflation and their quantitative effects before, during and after the GFC for a number of advanced and emerging market economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We construct a balanced panel data set for inflation and its potential drivers in 47 advanced and emerging market economies. Key variables include expected future inflation measured using professional forecasts and a foreign output gap measured using economy-specific trade weights. These variables allow us to estimate an open economy hybrid Phillips curve model for inflation and we formally test for possible structural breaks in the model parameters. We also track what the behaviour of variables in the model would predict for the level and volatility of inflation over time.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find relatively little significant change in the driving forces of inflation or their quantitative effects for most of the 47 economies over the sample period from 1996 to 2018. However, a notable change has been an increase in the average weight on expected future inflation for both advanced and emerging market economies. We find very heterogeneous but significant effects for inflation expectations, domestic and foreign output gaps, exchange rate pass-through, and oil prices, with generally higher sensitivities to external driving forces for emerging market economies. Consistent with the open economy hybrid Phillips curve model of inflation, the behaviour of the various inflation drivers, especially better anchored inflation expectations, can explain patterns of changes in the level and volatility of inflation across different economies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Inflation expectations are said to be anchored if long-horizon expectations do not change very much in response to shocks. Then any deviation in inflation from target will tend to revert over time. This gives central banks greater flexibility in deciding how to respond to shocks without losing control of inflation.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper uses the forecasts of professional forecasters to assess how well inflation expectations are anchored in a sample of 44 economies. It uses changes in forecasters' views of near-term inflation to identify shocks that are likely to affect inflation. If long-term expectations tend to move together with short-term expectations, then expectations are poorly anchored. By contrast, if long-term expectations remain stable even when short-term expectations change, then expectations are tightly anchored.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper shows that the share of economies with anchored expectations has increased over time. When we look to see why, we find that inflation targeting has played an important role. We also find that inflation expectations have remained well anchored over the last decade when inflation has been weak in many economies.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate pass-through from short-horizon to long-horizon inflation forecasts as a way to assess the anchoring of inflation expectations. We find an overall decline in the pass-through in our sample, with the share of economies having anchored expectations increasing over time. We then investigate what might explain the increase in anchoring. Inflation targeting plays an important role. Low policy rates and persistent deviations of inflation from target are correlated with a decline in expectations' pass-through. This suggests that longer-term expectations remain well anchored, despite recent low inflation out-turns in many economies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central banks in several advanced economies continue to rely on asset purchase programs to pursue their objectives. The costs and benefits of such policies, however, remain imperfectly understood. We try to shed light on these issues by studying the price effects of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) of the European Central Bank, which involved a sizable transfer of relatively illiquid securities from the private sector to central bank balance sheets.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We quantify the effect of the CSPP on the relative prices of the bonds eligible for purchase by employing a formal statistical framework of causal inference. Specifically, we make use of a regression discontinuity design specifically developed for evaluating programs such as the CSPP, in which eligibility is determined by an ordered categorical variable.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our estimates suggest that the program did not alter the yield spreads of the eligible bonds, relative to those of noneligible bonds, issued between the announcement of the program in March 2016 and the end of net purchases in December 2018. Even when restricting attention to the phase during which the holdings of corporate bonds under the CSPP reached their highest level, or to countries in which a larger share of corporate bonds are held by long-term investors, no such effects on the relative prices of the eligible bonds are found.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The causal effect of the European Central Bank's corporate bond purchase program on bond spreads in the primary market is evaluated,making use of a novel regression discontinuity design. The results indicate that the program did not, on average, permanently alter the yield spreads of eligible bonds relative to those of noneligible. Combined with evidence from previous studies, this finding suggests the effects of central bank asset purchase programs are in no way limited to the prices of the specific assets acquired.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We propose a method to compute the probability distribution of the potential fiscal cost of a banking crisis - a key input in assessing the adequacy of a country's fiscal buffers. Using a sample of banking crises in advanced and emerging market economies, we approximate the cost with the post-crisis increase in government debt. We then examine which pre-crisis economic developments help anticipate those costs. We finally use that information to compute the probability distribution of the costs for individual countries given prevailing economic conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A large literature has assessed the probability of banking crises, but relatively few studies have analysed their fiscal cost. And yet, for a policymaker, estimating the losses from a rare event such as a crisis should be at least as important as estimating its probability. We take a step towards filling this gap.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The level and growth of credit to the private non-financial sector, foreign exchange reserves and the ratio of bank capital to assets help predict the post-crisis increase in public debt. While they vary substantially across countries, the fiscal buffers against the risk of a banking crisis can be sizeable, far above 10% of GDP.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We propose a method for computing the distribution of the potential fiscal cost of a banking crisis - a key input in assessing the adequacy of a country's fiscal buffers. First, we use a cross-section of banking crises to identify the risk factors that predict the post-crisis increase in public sector debt - a measure of the overall fiscal cost of a crisis. Next, we use these risk factors to compute country-specific distributions of that cost in the event of a crisis. We find that the level and growth of credit to the private non-financial sector, foreign exchange reserves and the ratio of bank capital to assets are relevant predictors. As an illustration, we apply the method to the conditions prevailing in 2018 and find that the potential fiscal costs could be sizeable: with a probability of 95%, public debt could approach 40% of GDP on average across countries. Our illustrative estimates are probably upper bounds: while they indicate that higher bank capital can substantially reduce fiscal costs, they exclude the broader benefits of the wide-ranging reforms after the Great Financial Crisis.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This paper studies the global footprint of Chinese banks, and compares it with that of other major bank nationalities. Chinese banks account for 24% of all cross-border lending to borrowers in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), more than double that of Japanese banks, the closest competitor. Further, almost half of all EMDE borrowers rely on Chinese banks as their most important lender.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our paper makes three main contributions. First, it supports the need to follow a nationality approach in the analysis of global business operations, as international banks, and Chinese banks in particular, provide a substantial share of their cross-border lending from abroad. Second, it presents a new distance measure between borrowers and lenders that takes the global network of affiliates into account. Third, it contributes to a better understanding of China's role as a lender in international markets, in particular to EMDE borrowers.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Chinese banks have become the largest cross-border creditors for EMDEs. Their global reach resembles that of banks from advanced economies (AEs), with greater distances deterring their cross-border lending to EMDE borrowers relatively more than that to AEs. Conversely, Chinese banks' lending to EMDEs is deterred less by longer distances than that of their peer EMDE banks. Further, Chinese banks lend more to those EMDE borrowers with which strong bilateral trade relationships exist and, unlike other banks, they lend less to countries with large bilateral portfolio investments.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We explore the global footprint of Chinese banks and compare it with that of other bank nationalities. Chinese banks have become the largest cross-border creditors for almost half of all emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Their global reach resembles that of banks from advanced economies (AEs). We take a nationality approach as international banks, and Chinese banks in particular, grant a substantial share of their cross-border loans from affiliates located abroad. But differences remain. Using a gravity model with a novel measure of distance capturing the role of foreign affiliates across all bank nationalities, we find that larger distances deter crossborder bank lending to EMDEs more than to AEs. For Chinese banks, however, distance deters lending to EMDEs less than for peer EMDE banks. We show that for all banks combined, bilateral economic interactions like trade, FDI and portfolio investment, positively correlate with lending. Chinese banks' lending to EMDEs also strongly correlates with trade, but not with FDI and, unlike other banks, it correlates negatively with portfolio investment.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This note looks at different ways of constructing term rates from overnight rates. When LIBOR goes out of use, as planned for the end of 2021, financial contracts will need to use LIBOR's alternative rates. For the US market, this is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralised by Treasury securities. However, unlike LIBOR, which is a term rate, SOFR and the other alternative rates are all overnight rates.</p>
<p>Ideally, financial contracts would use a term rate based on compounded overnight rates over the interest rate period (a method known as "in arrears"). Doing that, the interest rate payment is known at the end of the period. This is already standard in the derivatives market. But, in the cash market, the standard so far is based on quarterly payments, where the interest rate payment is known at the beginning of an interest rate period. Hence, the need to change the standard in the cash market is hampering the shift from LIBOR to alternative rates.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We show how to optimally determine a term rate known at the beginning of an interest rate period by only using overnight rates (a method typically referred to as "in advance"). While the resulting term rates are known at the beginning - a desirable feature they share with LIBOR - a common objection is that this method introduces a lagged behaviour (or "basis"), which can be especially severe in periods when policy rates change rapidly. In this note, we analyse how the basis can be reduced.</p>
<p>To avoid using reference rates based on unreliable data, thus recreating the fallibility of LIBOR, only robust reference rates should be used, such as the alternatives to LIBOR. Using past overnight rates to determine the payment of the next interest period is robust.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In this note, we compare several approaches to reduce the basis by using term rates known at the beginning of the interest period. One approach includes an adjustment factor, which can be seen as the convenience premium to have the term rate pre-determined. We conclude that the ideal option is to use a shortened observation period when compounding overnight rates to derive a pre-determined term rate.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This note evaluates ways of how new loans can be based on risk-free overnight (O/N) rates, the chosen successors to LIBOR (e.g. SOFR in the US). So far, O/N rates have not been widely adopted in the loan market, as this market is used to know the term rate at the beginning of an interest period. The loan market would prefer to replace LIBOR with another forward-looking term rate, i.e. a term rate that is known at the beginning and reflects expectation. However, these term rates currently do not exist and have several disadvantages. Instead of a forward-looking term rate one can also use past realizations of O/N rates to define a term rate at the beginning of an interest rate period. A common objection by using past realizations of O/N rates is that this introduces a lagged behavior (or 'basis'), which can be especially severe in periods when policy rates change rapidly. In this note, we evaluate the basis and show ways how to minimize it. We conclude that the ideal option to reduce the basis is to use a shortened observation period when computing term rates based on past O/N rate realizations.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Gross capital flows play a central role in today's policy debates. Yet current theory largely relies on net flow models of saving and current accounts. This limits the scope of policy advice.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We extend the standard open economy macroeconomic model to include credit creation, thus allowing us to study gross capital flows. The model clarifies that it is shifts in cross-border gross financial positions, rather than changes in real saving, that finance economic activity. Financial shocks become a key source of real vulnerability. We shed new light on four classic policy debates around capital flows.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Gross capital flows depend critically on financial factors, such as banks' willingness to lend and household portfolio preferences. Real saving shocks have little and only indirect effects on gross positions. This has far-reaching implications. First, persistent US current account deficits are better explained by a domestic credit glut than the global saving glut. Second, gross flows are an important indicator of financial vulnerability, more so than real saving or current accounts. Third, there is no Triffin's current account dilemma (the assertion that US current account deficits are necessary to meet global demand for reserve currency) because dollars are created by banks rather than current account deficits. Fourth, the high correlations between gross capital inflows and outflows are overwhelmingly the result of double-entry bookkeeping.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Understanding gross capital flows is increasingly viewed as crucial for both macroeconomic and financial stability policies, but theory is lagging behind many key policy debates. We fill this gap by developing a two-country DSGE model that tracks domestic and cross-border gross positions between banks and households, with explicit settlement of all transactions through banks. We formalise the conceptual distinction between cross-border saving and financing, which often move in opposite directions in response to shocks. This matters for at least four policy debates. First, current accounts are poor indicators of financial vulnerability, because in a crisis, creditors stop financing debt rather than current accounts, and because following a crisis, current accounts are not the primary channel through which balance sheets adjust. Second, we reinterpret the global saving glut hypothesis by arguing that US households do not finance current account deficits with foreigners' physical saving, but with digital purchasing power, created by banks that are more likely to be domestic than foreign. Third, Triffin's current account dilemma is not in fact a dilemma, because the creation of additional US dollars requires dollar credit creation by US and non-US banks rather than US current account deficits. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed high correlation of gross capital inflows and outflows is overwhelmingly an automatic consequence of double entry bookkeeping, rather than the result of two separate sets of economic decisions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Managed floats remain the norm in middle-income countries - even among those that have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. Moreover, the decision to intervene appears to be increasingly driven by the goal of limiting exchange rate volatility, rather than concerns about competitiveness, the degree of exchange rate pass-through or the need to build foreign reserves for precautionary reasons. At the same time, intervention has often been highly sterilised, with the goal of avoiding broader macroeconomic effects. However, even when sterilised, intervention can have an impact on macroeconomic fluctuations and systemic financial risks. Research on these issues has been limited, despite greater recognition in recent years of the interactions between macroeconomic and financial stability.   </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study the effects of sterilised foreign exchange market intervention in a model with financial frictions and imperfect capital mobility. In the model, the central bank operates a managed float regime and follows a simple foreign exchange intervention rule that relates changes in its stock of foreign reserves to exchange rate movements. It also conducts sterilisation operations by issuing bonds held by commercial banks. Owing to economies of scope in managing bank assets, these bonds exhibit cost complementarity with investment loans. The model is parameterised for a middle-income country and is used to study the impact of capital inflows associated with a transitory shock to the world risk-free interest rate. We also consider the case where, when setting intervention and sterilisation policies, the central bank is explicitly concerned not only with maximising household welfare but also with the cost of sterilisation - possibly because it affects perceptions of its independence and credibility - as well as financial stability considerations.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find, first, that whether sterilised intervention is expansionary or not depends on the relative strengths of the standard liquidity effect and the bank portfolio effect; the stronger the portfolio effect, the more expansionary sterilised intervention can be. Second, when the central bank aims solely to maximise household welfare, the optimal degree of intervention is significantly more aggressive when the central bank can simultaneously choose the degree of sterilisation. In that sense, intervention and sterilisation are complements. However, the presence of the bank portfolio effect creates a trade-off and implies that full sterilisation is not optimal - even when the central bank is also explicitly concerned (in addition to household welfare) with exchange rate stability or financial volatility. By contrast, when economies of scope are absent, the bank portfolio effect no longer operates and full sterilisation is always optimal, and intervention and sterilisation remain complements. Third, when sterilisation costs are accounted for in the central bank's objective function and concern with these costs is sufficiently high, the optimal policy for the central bank is to intervene less and sterilise fully - regardless of whether economies of scope exist. In that sense, there is burden-sharing between instruments, and intervention and sterilisation are now (partial) substitutes. In the absence of the bank portfolio effect, a policy mix that involves less aggressive intervention and full sterilisation is also optimal - even when the central bank is also concerned with financial stability.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies the effects of sterilized foreign exchange market intervention in a model with financial frictions and imperfect capital mobility. The central bank operates a managed float regime and issues sterilization bonds that are imperfect substitutes (as a result of economies of scope) to investment loans in bank portfolios. The model is parameterized and used to study the macroeconomic effects of, and policy responses to, capital inflows associated with a transitory shock to world interest rates. The results show that sterilized intervention can be expansionary through a bank portfolio effect and may increase volatility and financial stability risks. Full sterilization is optimal only when the bank portfolio effect is absent. The optimal degree of intervention is more aggressive when the central bank can choose simultaneously the degree of sterilization; in that sense, the instruments are complements. When the central bank's objective function depends on the cost of sterilization, and concerns with that cost are sufficiently high, intervention and sterilization can be substitutes---independently of whether exchange rate and financial stability considerations also matter.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We look at periods where all initial public offerings (IPOs) were suspended in China in order to assess the effect of IPOs on stock markets and individual listed firms.    </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Initial public offering (IPO) activity was suspended across the board three times in China between 2008 and 2015. This allows us to examine the effects of delays in IPOs that are unaffected by individual firm and industry characteristics. In doing so, we use a panel approach that controls for prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Our analysis supports the argument that IPOs both increase competition and make asset markets more complete. We also find that stronger firms are less vulnerable to the adverse competitive effects of IPOs than are their weaker counterparts.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that listed firms stood to gain from IPO suspensions in two ways. These were (a) the implied weakening of competition from direct competitors; and (b) the reduced supply of share issues from firms with similar risk characteristics. Firms in industries that were more exposed to competition from firms waiting for IPOs at the time of the announcement had significantly greater one-day stock price returns, as did firms with similar risk characteristics. We also find that stronger firms, measured in terms of profitability and other proxies, gained less from news of the suspension. This implies that weaker firms are more vulnerable to competition from IPO candidate firms.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Theory suggests that initial public offerings (IPOs) can adversely impact listed firms, both directly by increasing intra-industry competition, and indirectly by completing related asset market spaces. However, the endogeneity of individual IPO activity hinders testing these channels. This paper examines listing suspensions in China in a panel specification that accounts for macroeconomic and financial conditions, isolating the firm-level IPO impact. We measure the competitive impact of listing suspensions through the value share of postponed firms in the IPO queue in their industry, and asset-space competition by firms' historical covariance with a synthetic portfolio of listed firms with the IPO queue industry mix at the time of suspension. Our results support the predicted IPO effects through both channels. We also document heterogeneity in IPO effects. Stronger firms-measured through a variety of proxies-benefit less from the suspension news. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Credit markets around the world are undergoing a deep transformation. While banks, credit unions and other traditional lenders remain the chief source of finance in most economies, with capital markets playing an important role in some cases, new intermediaries have recently emerged. In particular, digital lending models such as peer-to-peer and marketplace lending have grown in many economies in the past decade. These types of credit, facilitated by online platforms rather than traditional banks or lending companies, are referred to as "fintech credit". Moreover, in the past few years, many large companies whose primarily business is technology (big techs) have entered credit markets, providing "big tech credit" either directly or in partnership with financial institutions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Information on the size and characteristics of fintech and big tech credit is scarce. In this paper, we assemble and update available data on fintech and big tech credit volumes for 79 countries around the world over 2013-19. The database is made available as a resource for researchers, policymakers and practitioners. We answer the questions: how large are fintech and big tech credit markets, both in absolute terms and relative to overall credit markets? What economic and institutional factors are driving their growth and adoption? How large and important could they become in the future?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that in 2019, fintech and big tech credit (together "total alternative credit") reached nearly USD 800 billion globally. Big tech credit has shown particularly rapid growth in Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia), and some countries in Africa and Latin America. By contrast, fintech credit volumes declined in 2018-19 due to market and regulatory developments in China. Outside China, fintech credit is still growing. We find that these alternative forms of credit are more developed in countries with higher GDP per capita (at a declining rate), where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where banking regulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is also more developed where there are fewer bank branches per capita. We find that these alternative forms of credit are more developed where the ease of doing business is greater, investor protection disclosure and the efficiency of the judicial system are more advanced, the bank credit-to-deposit ratio is lower, and where bond and equity markets are more developed. Overall, both fintech and big tech credit seems to complement other forms of credit, rather than substitute for them,­ and may increase overall access to credit.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Fintech and big tech platforms have expanded their lending around the world. We estimate that the flow of these new forms of credit reached USD 223 billion and USD 572 billion in 2019, respectively. China, the United States and the United Kingdom are the largest markets for fintech credit. Big tech credit is growing fast in China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and some countries in Africa and Latin America. Cross-country panel regressions show that such lending is more developed in countries with higher GDP per capita (at a declining rate), where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where banking regulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is larger where there are fewer bank branches per capita. We also find that fintech and big tech credit are more developed where the ease of doing business is greater, and investor protection disclosure and the efficiency of the judicial system are more advanced, the bank creditto- deposit ratio is lower and where bond and equity markets are more developed. Overall, alternative credit seems to complement other forms of credit, rather than substitute for them.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Very often, different vendors sell the same goods at very different prices. If poorer households are willing to search more and pay lower prices than wealthier ones, consumption inequality should be lower than expenditure inequality. We explore the importance of this distinction.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Most previous studies on consumption inequality implicitly assumed that consumption and expenditure are equivalent. On the empirical side, expenditure data are commonly used to measure consumption. On the theoretical side, the price of consumption was assumed to be unity. However, there is growing evidence that consumers differ in their shopping efforts, so that they pay different prices for the same goods. Our contribution is to differentiate consumption from expenditure by incorporating the price search decision into an otherwise standard life-cycle model. We calibrate the model to the US economy and quantify the importance of this extension.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our benchmark results suggest that, compared with expenditure inequality, consumption inequality is about 40 percent lower and it increases 30 percent less over the life-cycle. In addition, the availability of the price search option provides a powerful insurance mechanism against adverse income shocks and increases the welfare of a new-born by 3.9 percent in consumption equivalent terms.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper, we differentiate consumption from expenditure by incorporating price search decision into an otherwise standard life-cycle model. With this extension, households can pay lower prices for the same consumption good if they allocate more time for price search. We first analytically show that under very general conditions, poorer (in both income and/or wealth) households search more and pay lower prices compared with wealthier ones. As a result, consumption inequality is smaller than expenditure inequality, and the gap between them increases over the life-cycle. Next, we quantify these mechanisms by calibrating our model to the US data. We find that the life-cycle increase in consumption inequality is about 30 percent lower than the increase in expenditure inequality. We also show that the availability of a price search option provides a large insurance mechanism against adverse income shocks and increases the welfare of a new born by 3.9 percent in consumption equivalent terms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The housing market in the US (and in many other countries) experienced a boom-bust cycle during the last two decades. Real house prices increased by more than 30 percent between 1995 and 2006, and then dropped by a similar amount until 2011. The financial sector and the rest of the economy also experienced a boom-bust cycle. This paper studies the role of credit supply in driving these dynamics. More broadly, we argue that shifts in credit supply can generate large economic fluctuations and can have significant real effects.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a quantitative general equilibrium model that combines three sectors of the economy that played critical roles during the boom-bust episode: (i) a rich heterogeneous agent overlapping-generations structure of households who face idiosyncratic income risk and make housing tenure decisions (own, rent, refinance and default), (ii) banks that issue short-term loans to firms and long-term mortgages to households and whose ability to intermediate funds depends on their capital, and (iii) firms that finance part of their wage bill (working capital) through short-term loans from banks. We generate exogenous movements in credit supply by changing the tightness of bank capital constraints, ie leverage, and show that it can generate sizable fluctuations in the housing market and the rest of the economy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Reasonable shifts in bank leverage, ie a relaxation followed by reversal, can generate a boom-bust cycle in the economy, similar to the one observed around 2008. The main driver is that the increase credit supply lowers bank lending rate, which, in turn, initiates a boom both directly via lower borrowing costs and indirectly through general equilibrium effects, most importantly wages. The reversal of bank leverage, on the other hand, causes a sharper downturn due to the jump in bank lending rate, as bank net worth contracts sharply.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Can shifts in the credit supply generate a boom-bust cycle similar to the one observed in the US around 2008? To answer this question, we develop a general equilibrium model that combines a rich heterogeneous agent overlapping-generations structure of households who make housing tenure decisions and borrow through long-term mortgages, firms that finance their working capital through short-term loans from banks, and banks whose ability to intermediate funds depends on their capital. Using a calibrated version of this framework, we find that shocks to banks' leverage can generate sizable boom-bust cycles in the housing market, the banking sector, and the rest of the macroeconomy, which provides strong support for the credit supply channel. The deterioration of bank balance sheets during the bust, the existence of highly leveraged households, and the general equilibrium feedback from the credit supply to household labor income significantly amplify the bust. Moreover, mortgage credit growth across the income distribution is consistent with recent findings that were otherwise argued to be against the credit supply channel. A comparison of the model outcomes across credit supply, house price expectation, and productivity shocks suggests that housing busts accompanied by severe banking crises are more likely to be generated by credit supply shocks.</p>

<p><em>Paper produced as part of the BIS Consultative Council for the Americas Research Network project "<a href="/am_office/rsn/erkdeit.htm">Exchange rates: key drivers and effects on inflation and trade</a>"</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>I use a simple model to study the econometric implications of allowing multi-product retailers to choose their markups on a price dynamics identification equation. To test the implications, I use a novel set of micro data which includes 23 million observations of merchandise prices and identifies the type of store where the product is sold.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The model gives a closed form for the optimal markup of retailers that produces an estimate of the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). The markup is equal to those in the previous literature (where retailers are assumed to operate under perfect competition) plus a correction (or flexible) term, proportional to the market shares of retailers. This term is usually negative. If retailers have no market power, the ERPT in my model is the usual ERPT, as estimated by the traditional literature. But if some retailers have market power, for example, because they are a large chain, then the ERPT as usually measured has a (most likely negative) bias that can be corrected easily. This contribution allows researchers with information on stores in price data sets to easily correct ERPT estimations both prospectively and historically. This also raises the question of the implications for monetary policy, given that ERPT has been underestimated for decades.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>I first find that, in Mexico, ERPT varies by the type of store: stores that belong to a chain have a lower ERPT. Then, consistent with the model, I find that, controlling for the store type, the ERPT estimate is larger than the usual ERPT, which does not control for store type. This is because the store type coefficient captures the store's flexibility in setting its markup. Finally, when using data only for stores that do not belong to a chain, I find (i) that the ERPT estimate is larger than the usual estimate, and (ii) that this estimate does not change if the store type is used as a control.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>I develop a structural model with nested CES preferences to obtain optimal markups for heterogeneous retailers when the prices of all their inputs are exogenous. The model predicts that, if the taste parameters are constant over time, the markups for retailers with higher market share are higher but have more flexibility, implying an incomplete pass-through of retailer input price into final retailer prices. I then focus on the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) and use a unique data set of all the price changes of tradeable merchandise in the Mexican Consumer Price Index (CPI) data by store type to test the model. I find, consistent with the model, that (1) ERPT is different by store type; and (2) products sold in stores with negligible market share have the same ERPT regardless of the store type. Both results imply that the ERPT is estimated with bias when the store information is not used.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Discussion of inflation risks, especially whether risks to future inflation are balanced or tilted to the upside or downside, often take centre stage in central bank policy meetings and communication. Policymakers often consider not only the most likely future path of inflation but also the full range of possible outcomes around that path. However, there is limited research on inflation risks and the factors that drive them, even for emerging market economies (EMEs) where inflation has generally been higher and more volatile.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We investigate inflation risks and their drivers in a large sample of advanced and emerging market economies. The starting point of our analysis is a Phillips curve, a workhorse model that links inflation to its main determinants. To investigate inflation-at-risk, the Phillips curve is estimated as a quantile regression. We use this type of regression because it highlights when tail risks for inflation - that is, the chance of very high or low inflation - evolve differently from average outcomes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that, across most economies, upside inflation risks have generally fallen over time. This reflects the adoption of inflation targeting frameworks and the success that central banks have had in controlling inflation. Relevant inflation risk drivers differ across groups of countries. In advanced economies, being at the zero lower bound raises the probability of very low inflation outcomes. In EMEs, large exchange rate depreciations raise the probability of high inflation outcomes. We also find that tightening financial conditions increase both upside and downside tail risks, especially in EMEs.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We examine how inflation risks have changed over time in a large panel of advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs). Quantile regressions show a general decline in upside inflation risks over time, reflecting successful disinflationary processes and the adoption of inflation targeting regimes. But important non-linearities remain. In advanced economies, the zero lower bound represents a prominent source of downside inflation risk. In EMEs, the exchange rate remains a powerful source of nonlinearity, with large exchange rate depreciations associated with upside inflation risks. Tightening financial conditions increase both up- and downside inflation risks.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We analyse zombie firms, defined as unprofitable firms with low stock market valuation. Our analysis takes a longer-run international perspective using firm-level data on listed non-financial companies covering 14 advanced economies and spanning three decades.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Documenting the rise of zombie companies over the past three decades, we explore their anatomy and life cycle. Their anatomy is analysed in terms of their economic and financial characteristics and performance, as compared with those of non-zombie firms. To flesh out a zombie firm's life cycle, we study how key balance sheet and profit account items move in the years before and after the firm first becomes a zombie. We further document what happened to zombie firms over time, zooming in on those firms that have managed to recover from zombie state.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find a rise in the share of zombie firms from 4% in the late 1980s to 15% in 2017. These zombie firms are smaller, less productive, more leveraged and invest less in physical and intangible capital. Their performance deteriorates several years before zombification and remains poor in subsequent years. 25% of zombie companies exited the market (died), while 60% formally recovered from zombie status. However, recovered zombies underperform compared to firms that have never been zombies and they face a high probability of relapsing into zombie status.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Collateral is used in debt contracts to mitigate the difficulties ("agency problems") that arise when the lender's knowledge of the borrower is incomplete ("asymmetric information"). Banks usually require borrowers to pledge tangible assets, such as real estate, to help offset such problems in credit assessment, or to reduce moral hazard and enforcement problems. By contrast, large technology firms ("big techs") can use massive amounts of data ("big data") to better assess firms' creditworthiness. These capabilities could help to reduce the importance of collateral in solving asymmetric information problems in credit markets.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper compares how credit from a big tech firm and traditional bank lending correlate with local economic activity, house prices and firm-specific characteristics. It is based on a unique random sample of more than 2 million Chinese firms that received credit from both an important big tech firm (Ant Group) and traditional commercial banks. The paper also asks how the increased use of big data instead of collateral could affect how the provision of credit responds to collateral values. This "financial accelerator mechanism" has historically amplified the effects of financial market developments and asset prices on the real economy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that big tech credit does not correlate with local business conditions and house prices when controlling for demand factors, but that it does react strongly to changes in firm-specific characteristics, such as the transaction volumes and network scores used to calculate firm credit ratings. This is particularly the case when a borrower firm conducts its business activity on the relevant e-commerce platform. By contrast, both secured and unsecured bank credit reacts significantly to local house price dynamics, which incorporate useful information on the client's creditworthiness and the business conditions in which it operates. This implies that, if big techs make greater use of machine learning and big data to provide credit, collateral would become less significant in lending, potentially weakening the financial accelerator mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Update - July 2022</strong></p>
<p><a href="/publ/work880_data_jul22.xlsx">Updated dataset</a> on CBDC projects <a href="/publ/work880_updates_jul22.pptx">around the world</a>.</p>
<p>There are now four live retail CBDCs in the world – in The Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean, Nigeria and Jamaica. There are 29 pilots and 72 central banks have communicated publicly about their CBDC work.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are in the limelight. But the reasons for issuing them vary between countries, as do the policy approaches and technical designs. This paper looks at the economic and institutional motives behind current CBDC projects and asks how they might shape the design of such currencies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We draw up a database of research and development work, technical approaches and policy stances for the issuance of CBDCs. We assess the policy stance based on a database of more than 16,000 central bank speeches. We also take stock of actual development efforts, providing a taxonomy of technical designs from all relevant policy and analytical publications published by central banks worldwide. Next we look at the drivers of CBDC projects by relating development intensity to the economic and institutional differences between countries. Based on public reports and interviews with central bank experts, we set out the policy approaches behind three CBDC projects: China's Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DC/EP), Sweden's e-krona and the Bank of Canada's CBDC contingency plan.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>On the drivers for CBDC development, we find that most projects originate in digitised and innovative economies. Retail CBDC work is more advanced where the informal economy is larger. None of the projects surveyed seeks to replace cash - all aim to offer a digital complement.</p>
<p>On the technical designs, we find that more and more central banks are considering "Hybrid" or "Intermediated" architectures, where the CBDC is a cash-like direct claim on the central bank but the private sector manages all customer-facing activity. Only a few jurisdictions are considering "Direct" designs, in which the central bank takes on some or all of the customer-facing side of payments. At present, no central bank reports that it is pursuing a "Synthetic" or "Indirect" CBDC design.</p>
<p>While central banks are considering various technical infrastructures, current proofs-of-concept tend to be based on distributed ledger technology rather than a conventional infrastructure. Access frameworks tend to be based on account identification rather than allowing for token-based anonymity. Most retail CBDC projects have a domestic focus.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are receiving more attention than ever before. Yet the motivations for issuance vary across countries, as do the policy approaches and technical designs. We investigate the economic and institutional drivers of CBDC development and take stock of design efforts. We set out a comprehensive database of technical approaches and policy stances on issuance, relying on central bank speeches and technical reports. Most projects are found in digitised economies with a high capacity for innovation. Work on retail CBDCs is more advanced where the informal economy is larger. We next take stock of the technical design options. More and more central banks are considering retail CBDC architectures in which the CBDC is a direct cash-like claim on the central bank, but where the private sector handles all customer-facing activity. We conclude with an in-depth description of three distinct CBDC approaches by the central banks of China, Sweden and Canada.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; color: #372f32;">When a country's exchange rate falls, the effect on corporate balance sheets may become significant. A firm that borrows in foreign currency is vulnerable to unexpected exchange rate movements if its currency exposures are not fully hedged operationally (eg the firm exports) or financially (eg with financial derivatives). A depreciation can weaken the firm's balance sheet and thus hinder investment. This paper studies such balance sheet effects in a sample of 15 emerging market economies (EMEs).</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; color: #372f32;">There is scant cross-country evidence on how depreciations affect corporate investment. This is mainly due to data limitations, as there are no available cross-country databases on the currency composition of firms' liabilities. This paper assembles a novel firm-level database on foreign currency debt based on data for the issuance of corporate bonds by listed non-financial corporations in 15 EMEs in the period 2000-15. The paper further uses data on firms' balance sheets, income and cash flow statements to control for time-varying firm-specific factors that may affect investment decisions, including firms' export status and access to foreign financing via foreign listings and equity ownership by foreign investors. </span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; color: #372f32;">The results indicate that currency depreciations do affect corporate investment, as measured by capital expenditure. A depreciation of 10% is associated with a ratio of capital expenditure to assets of between 0.3 and 0.4 percentage points less in the year of the depreciation, and between 0.5 and 0.6 percentage points less in the following year. This result applies to firms with previous outstanding stocks of foreign currency bonds vis-à-vis their peers with no such exposure. As a reference, the average ratio of capital expenditure to assets in the estimating sample is 5.6%; thus, the effect is also economically significant.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper explores the effect of depreciations on investment when firms hold foreign currency debt. The paper employs a novel database of stocks of foreign currency bonds issued by seven thousand firms from emerging economies in 2000-2015. The results indicate that currency depreciations exert a significant negative effect on balance sheets. A depreciation of 10 percent is associated with a ratio of capital expenditures to assets of between 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points less for firms with outstanding stocks of foreign currency bonds in the year following the depreciation. This result is robust to different inference techniques and to controlling for a<br/>large number of potential confounders.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Early warning indicators for financial crises are important inputs for central bankers to guide macroprudential policies. One such indicator -the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from a long-run trend, in short the credit-to-GDP gap - is very useful in this regard. Basel III therefore suggests that policymakers use it as part of their countercyclical capital buffer frameworks. However, several authors have critisised the technicalities to drive the trend and have suggested alternatives. We agree with these criticisms. Yet, in the absence of clear theoretical foundations, all proposed alternatives are but indicators. It is therefore an empirical question which measure performs best as an early warning indicator for crises - the question we address in this paper.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We compare how well differently derived credit-to-GDP gap perform as early warning indicators. We use quarterly data, from 1970 to 2017, for 41 economies. We first compare different linear projections, to see which performs best. We do this both looking at each economy separately, and using a panel. We then compare this against other measures, including our baseline one which was suggested by the Basel Committee.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that credit gaps based on linear projections perform poorly when applied to each country separately. But when we estimate as a panel, and impose the same coefficients on all economies, they do well. They perform slightly better than our baseline measure, although the difference is small. The practical relevance of the improvement is limited, though. Over a ten year horizon policy makers could expect one less wrong call on average.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The credit gap, defined as the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from a one-sided HP-filtered trend, is a useful indicator for predicting financial crises. Basel III therefore suggests that policymakers use it as part of their countercyclical capital buffer frameworks. Hamilton (2018), however, argues that you should never use an HP filter as it results in spurious dynamics, has end-point problems and its typical implementation is at odds with its statistical foundations. Instead he proposes the use of linear projections. Some have also criticised the normalisation by GDP, since gaps will be negatively correlated with output. We agree with these criticisms. Yet, in the absence of clear theoretical foundations, all proposed gaps are but indicators. It is therefore an empirical question which measure performs best as an early warning indicator for crises. We run a horse race using expanding samples on quarterly data from 1970 to 2017 for 41 economies. We find that credit gaps based on linear projections in real time perform poorly when based on country-by-country estimation, and are subject to their own end-point problem. But when we estimate as a panel, and impose the same coefficients on all economies, linear projections perform marginally better than the baseline credit-to-GDP gap, with somewhat larger improvements concentrated in the post-2000 period and for emerging market economies. The practical relevance of the improvement is limited, though. Over a ten year horizon policy makers could expect one less wrong call on average.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Foreign financing provides external finance and better financing conditions to exporters in the developing world. Through this channel, it increases their export survival rates and could therefore foster economic development.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Export survival rates are smaller in developing countries than in advanced economies, and this explains a large part of the long-term export growth differential between them. However, very little has been said about whether foreign financing can increase export survival, through the provision of external finance and better financing conditions.</p>
<p>We address this issue for a developing country, Argentina, by using a unique firm-level dataset that contains rich information on the domestic and foreign financing of exporting firms. We show that exporters tend to borrow in countries in which interest rates were smaller than in Argentina, suggesting that monetary and liquidity conditions were easier in these economies. Then, we employ standard empirical techniques used in the survival literature, specifically the probit random effects and the clog-log setups, to test whether foreign financing increases export survival. Finally, we run robustness check analysis with an Instrumental Variable empirical setup.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, using the standard techniques in the survival literature, we find that even after controlling for firm-level characteristics, such as domestic financing and size, the amount of foreign financing obtained by an exporter improves its export survival prospects.</p>
<p>Second, instrumenting for the foreign financing of Argentine firms with the money market interest rates of the foreign countries in which they borrowed, we provide further support for this result.</p>
<p>Mapping these outcomes onto other findings in the literature, we interpret these results as evidence that foreign financing makes it possible to cover and reduce exporting costs that are faced recurrently, multiple times, once a firm has already entered the export market. A theoretical model we develop is consistent with this interpretation of the results.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Exporting is a finance-intensive activity. But credit markets are frequently underdeveloped and domestic financing tends to be scarce in developing countries, for which a strong export sector is crucial for economic development. Thus, this paper investigates whether foreign financing provides better financing conditions than domestic financing and/or otherwise unavailable external finance, thus increasing export survival rates in a developing country. To that end, it assembles a unique dataset, rarely available for other countries, containing information on foreign credit obtained by Argentine exporters. Based on the empirical models conventionally used in the export survival literature - specifically the probit random effects and the clog-log setups - we provide evidence of a positive link between foreign financing and export survival. This finding is confirmed using an instrumental variable approach.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Higher debt increases during credit booms tend to be followed by relatively sharper crisis episodes. The literature established this empirical regularity at the country or region level. Using contract level information from the Brazilian Credit Registry matched with information on labor income from the Ministry of Labor, this paper explores the individual borrower level underpinnings of this phenomenon.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper shows that a higher increase in debt-to-income ratio at the individual level during the credit expansion period in Brazil predicts a lower consumption during the subsequent crisis. Furthermore, this effect is stronger when borrowers use credit types commonly presenting higher interest rates.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The later phase of the Brazilian household debt boom, occurring between 2011 and 2014, had government banks playing the lead roles. We provide evidence of that by comparing government and private bank loans to individuals who borrow from both. Also, public employees were more exposed to this credit expansion than private sector employees. Comparing these groups of workers, we isolate the increase in debt-to- income ratio caused by a credit supply shock and show that it resulted in a relative reduction of consumption. This happened mainly among the borrowers belonging to the lowest income quintile.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>After the global financial crisis, government banks in Brazil boosted credit provision to households, generating a sharp increase in household debt which was followed by the most severe recession in recent Brazilian history in 2015-2016. Using a novel individual-level data set including matched credit registry and employer-employee information, we show that individuals with higher debt-to-income growth during the boom experienced lower subsequent credit card expenditure during the recession. To identify the credit-supply effect, we exploit individuals borrowing from both government-controlled and private banks. We show that, during the late stages of the boom period, government banks increased their lending more than private banks to the same individual. To study the effect of this credit supply shock on individual consumption, we exploit variation in the sector of employment of each borrower. Individuals employed by the public sector were disproportionately targeted by payroll loans offered by government banks and experienced larger decline in credit card spending during the subsequent recession.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Our paper examines the impact of beliefs and pricing mistakes during the boom in subprime lending of the early 2000's. We collect original data on private and FHA mortgage insurance premiums from 19992016. This details the evolution of offerings in their scope as well as in their price. To characterize the overall pricing of mortgage insurance, as borrowers substitute among loan types, we construct chainweighted price indexes of insurance products in four risk categories. These indexes reveal broad changes in the pricing of default risk over time, but cannot distinguish between changes in the underlying credit risk from changes in the accuracy of risk pricing.</p>
<p>To distinguish between changes in the quantity versus pricing of credit risk, we fit a parametric model of default behavior to PMI prices in 2013. This quantifies default risk conditional on borrower's equity, the distribution of house price changes, and borrower credit worthiness. With 2013 PMI premiums as our benchmark, but allowing for differing expectations about house price appreciation, we judge the accuracy of premiums in 2005.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>There was a large increase in higher risk mortgage lending in the United States in the early 2000s. Expectations of higher house price appreciation shared between borrowers and lenders can explain this by reducing default risk and lowering the user cost of ownership. A shift in the supply of risky loans can also explain this, inducing borrowers to borrow more with lower rates. There is an active and ongoing dispute about the relative contributions of optimism and mispricing in this lending boom. We contribute to this debate by identifying a pattern of mispricing in higher risk mortgage lending and estimating the quantitative effects of this mispricing on the market for risky mortgages.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our examination of mortgage credit risk pricing yields two findings: The boom in high-risk mortgages was a response to both the mispricing of risk and to optimistic beliefs about house prices. The mispricing largely stemmed from pooling across widely disparate credit risks, and resulted in adverse selection within the pool. In comparing the, insurance premiums for riskier products in 2005 versus 2013, we find they were not systematically higher in 2013, just differentiated by FICO score, as the errors implied by pooling were eliminated. For the highest-risk products, primarily insured by the government, insurance was underpriced both before and after 2008. But the insurance premiums themselves were substantially higher by 2013, consistent with more pessimistic beliefs about housing markets. We find that the 2005 mispricing contributed in the vicinity of 2 to 15 percentage points of the 24 percentage point difference in the share of high-risk mortgages in 2005 versus 2013, the remainder due to "rationing," i.e. changes in lending practices that virtually eliminated loans to the riskiest borrowers at any price.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We provide new evidence that credit supply shifts contributed to the U.S. subprime mortgage boom and bust. We collect original data on both government and private mortgage insurance premiums from 1999-2016, and document that prior to 2008, premiums did not vary across loans with widely different observable characteristics that we show were predictors of default risk. Then, using a set of post-crisis insurance premiums to fit a model of default behavior, and allowing for time-varying expectations about house price appreciation, we quantify the mispricing of default risk in premiums prior to 2008. We show that the flat premium structure, which necessarily resulted in safer mortgages cross-subsidizing riskier ones, produced substantial adverse selection. Government insurance maintained a flatter premium structure even post-crisis, and consequently also suffered from adverse selection. But after 2008 the government reduced its exposure to default risk through a combination of higher premiums and rationing at the extensive margin.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the aging demographics of the workforce in the United States. Since 1980, the average age of the workforce has increased and the share of total earnings of older workers has risen significantly. Concurrent with these demographic changes, the share of income paid to workers (labor's share) has declined. We hypothesis that as a worker ages their labor market dynamism declines and the employer has greater labor market power in determining a worker's wage. Further, the greater market power of an employer leads to a gap between a worker's earnings and their productivity which increases as a worker ages. Therefore, as the workforce ages the average gap between earnings and productivity of workers widens which results in a lower share of total income accruing to workers.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The decline in labor's share in the United States, and globally, has raised concerns regarding the distribution of income and its impact on inequality of income and wealth. The extent to which the decline has contributed to income and wealth inequality, as well as whether this decline is a result of underlying changes in technology or market failures, is important in determining if and how policy makers should respond to these changes. To quantify the contribution of aging to the decline in labor's share, we develop a framework to estimate age-specific gaps between the earnings and productivity of a worker. Cross-industry data containing payroll shares and the age-distribution of earnings from the United States from 1987 to 2011 is used to estimate the age-specific gaps.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We estimate that workers receive a smaller share of their productivity in earnings as they age, therefore, earnings growth lags productivity and the gap between the two grows over the worker's life. Our estimates imply that the observed increase in earnings accruing to older workers accounts for fifty-nine percent of the post-1980 decline in the labor's share in the United States and fifty-four percent of the post-1975 global decline.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since 1980, the earnings share of older workers has risen in the United States, simultaneous with a historic decline in labor's share of income. We hypothesize that an aging workforce has contributed to the decline in labor's share. We formalize this hypothesis in an on-the-job search model, in which employers of older workers may have substantial monopsony power due to the decline in labor market dynamism that accompanies age. This manifests as a rising wedge between a worker's earnings and marginal product over the life-cycle. We estimate the age profile of these wedges using cross-industry responses of labor shares to changes in the age-distribution of earnings. We find that a sixty-year-old worker receives half of her marginal product relative to when she was twenty, which, together with recent demographic trends, can account for 59% of the recent decline in the U.S. labor share. Industrial heterogeneity in this age profile is consistent with the monopsony-power mechanism: highly unionized industries exhibit no relationship between age and payroll shares.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Long-term real interest rates play an important part in the transmission of monetary policy measures to aggregate demand. But there are concerns that the unconventional monetary policy tool of forward guidance may not be effective when policy rates fall to zero, ie reach their zero lower bound (ZLB). A further concern is that the publication of policy rate forecasts at the ZLB may be perceived as an unconditional commitment, thus undermining the credibility of monetary policy. We investigate both these concerns for the policy rate forecasts made by the Federal Reserve in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study how surprises in the Fed's SEP policy rate forecasts made at the ZLB affect real yields and breakeven inflation rates across the yield curve. We use forward rates with horizons from two to 10 years ahead derived from nominal and index-linked US government bonds.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that surprises in the SEP policy rate forecasts significantly affect real yields in the expected direction across the yield curve. By contrast, breakeven inflation rates are little affected, including five-year breakeven inflation rates five years ahead, a common measure of monetary policy credibility. This suggests that policy rate forecasts by the Fed at the ZLB managed to affect real yields without adversely affecting monetary policy credibility.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Macroprudential instruments, which play a key role in the current policy debate, have a long history. Some of the tools in current use originated as monetary policy instruments that were deployed in order to influence the credit supply. For example, the Netherlands used credit restrictions as a monetary policy instrument from the 1960s to the early 1990s. We study the effects of these credit restrictions on the balance sheet structure of banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our contribution is to study the effects of credit restrictions on the balance sheet structure of banks and non-bank financial institutions. We analyse the effects separately for different types of bank - commercial banks, cooperatives, saving banks and mortgage banks - and institutional investors, since credit restrictions were not applied uniformly across different types of financial institution. This lets us compare "treated" with "untreated" institutions. We can also investigate to what extent credit controls led to leakages through cross-sectoral substitution and regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that banks responded to credit restrictions by switching to long-term funding with a view to facilitating credit supply while still meeting the restrictions. Most categories of lending were not affected by credit controls and some even increased following the implementation of restrictions. Arguably, the restrictions were effective in reaching their main goal, ie containing money growth. Our results also suggest that the credit restrictions contributed to financial stability by making Dutch financial institutions more reliant on stable sources of funding.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Credit restrictions were used as a monetary policy instrument in the Netherlands from the 1960s to the early 1990s. We study the effects of credit restrictions being active on the balance sheet structure of banks and other financial institutions. We find that banks mainly responded to credit restrictions by making adjustments to the liability side of their balance sheets, particularly by increasing the proportion of long-term funding. Responses on the asset side were limited, while part of the banking sector even increased lending after the installment of a restriction. These results suggest that banks and financial institutions responded by switching to long-term funding to meet the restriction and shield their lending business. Arguably, the credit restrictions were therefore still effective in reaching their main goal, i.e. containing money growth.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In the social sciences, the idea of the well endowed receiving further privilege, eg the rich getting richer, is often called the "Matthew effect" (New Testament Book of Matthew, 25:29). In economics, this effect is relevant particularly for wealth inequality. The effect could be amplified by financial development and technological advances that give investors access to better financial services or to assets with higher returns.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We test for the Matthew effect with micro data from the Italian Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) conducted by the Bank of Italy over the period 1991-2016. To assess whether financial development and financial technology increase wealth inequality, we analyse households' wealth and financial returns against indicators of financial development of the territory where the family resides (number of bank branches) and households' use of remote banking, as one form of financial technology (fintech) adoption. This provides further empirical evidence for higher returns by the wealthy, sheds light on the impact of financial development and fintech, and identifies a channel through which technology may contribute to greater wealth inequality if not sufficiently diffused among the population.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that households' financial wealth and financial returns are higher when there is greater financial development and fintech adoption. While households of all wealth deciles benefit from the effects of financial development and financial technology, these effects increase when moving towards the top of the wealth distribution. Still, the economic significance of this gap fell after 2004, as remote banking started to be more diffused among the population and the number of bank branches declined.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper analyses the role of financial development and financial technology in driving inequality in (returns to) wealth. Using micro data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) conducted by the Bank of Italy for the period 1991-2016, we find evidence of the "Matthew effect" - a capacity of wealthy households to achieve higher returns than other households. With an instrumental variable approach, we find that financial development (number of bank branches) and financial technology (use of remote banking) both have a positive association with households' financial wealth and financial returns. While households of all wealth deciles benefit from the effects of financial development and financial technology, these benefits are larger when moving towards the top of the wealth distribution. Still, the economic significance of this gap fell in the last part of the sample period, as remote banking became more widespread.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central banks whose policy rates have reached their effective lower bound have turned to unconventional policies, including forward guidance, to stimulate their economies. These policies have international ramifications. We explore how forward guidance policy in large economies, such as the United States, affects smaller economies, such as Canada.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a novel definition of forward guidance shocks and show how to identify these shocks in estimated open economy models. We also provide quantitative estimates of the effect of US forward guidance policy on the US and Canadian economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Expansionary forward guidance shocks in the United States are contractionary for the Canadian economy. However, because of expansionary policy settings in Canada, including forward guidance from the Bank of Canada, the net effect of monetary policy settings over the past decade has been expansionary for both economies. Forward guidance spillovers are state-dependent, and are smaller when risk-aversion in the United States is high. The model's estimated forward guidance shocks are consistent with significant US monetary policy announcements, such as the introduction of calendar-based forward guidance.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We estimate a two-country model of the US and Canada over the post 2009 sample to study the cross-country spillovers of forward guidance shocks. To do so, we propose a method to identify forward guidance shocks during the fixed interest rate regime. US forward guidance shocks have a larger impact than conventional monetary policy shocks. A 2 quarter expansionary forward guidance shock decreases Canadian output by about 0.2% to 0.4% on impact. The effect of US forward guidance shocks on Canadian output, unlike conventional policy shocks, depends crucially on the state of the US risk premium shock. The estimated forward guidance shocks coincide with significant US monetary policy announcements such as the introduction of calendar based guidance.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We investigate how stable long-term inflation expectations were in the 1996-2019 period. Stable, well anchored long-term inflation expectations imply that the public believes the central bank can achieve its target. Yet, inflation ran below the targeted level in many countries for a long time. Furthermore, many central banks have hit the effective lower bound for interest rates and cannot lower them further.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our contribution is to use a panel framework to consider the effects of short-term inflation expectations on long-term inflation expectations. We do this for both advanced and emerging economies. We also consider the effect of persistent deviations of inflation from target. In addition, we contribute to the policy debate about the anchoring of inflation expectations.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Long-term inflation expectations are less well anchored in emerging market economies than in advanced ones. This is true both before and after the global financial crisis. Furthermore, persistent deviations of inflation from target affect long-term inflation expectations in advanced economies. Yet, persistent deviations do not have a stronger impact at the effective lower bound. Moreover, we find evidence for asymmetry. Higher than targeted inflation has a larger impact than lower than targeted inflation.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the anchoring properties of long-term inflation expectations in emerging and advanced economies, as a measure of monetary policy credibility. We proxy anchoring by how short-term expectations relate to long-term inflation expectations. We find that long-term inflation expectations are less well anchored in emerging than in advanced economies for the period 1996-2019. These findings do not significantly differ between before and after the global financial crisis or away from and at the effective lower bound. We also find that persistent deviations of inflation from target affect long-term inflation expectations in advanced economies. Yet, persistent deviations do not have a stronger impact at the effective lower bound. Moreover, we find evidence for asymmetry: higher than targeted inflation has a larger impact on long-term inflation expectations.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We examine how corporate bond fund managers manipulate the risk of their portfolios in response to competitive pressure. How bond funds react to the pressures of competition and investor redemptions is important, given the sector's strong growth over the past few years. Corporate bond funds also matter from the standpoint of financial stability, because the funds allow their shareholders to pull out their money any time, even if the underlying assets are difficult for the asset manager to sell quickly. Market turbulence can ensue if managers are forced to sell off illiquid assets in so-called fire sales.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>While it is generally agreed how competition influences the risk-taking of equity mutual funds, little is known about its effects on mutual funds that invest in corporate bonds. Yet such funds may be very significant from both a financial stability standpoint and also for the functioning of the real economy, given their role in supplying credit to firms. This paper contributes to the still fairly limited literature on this topic.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that the incentives prevailing in the corporate bond fund sector lead managers of underperforming funds to reduce their risk-taking by investing in safer securities that are easier to sell. They do this mainly by selling cheap (ie higher-yielding) bonds and, at the same time, purchasing more liquid ones with lower yields. This de-risking behaviour is the opposite of what happens in the equity fund sector.</p>
<p>Overall, we argue that the incentive structure of the bond fund industry has some advantages. By de-risking their portfolios, fund managers reduce the risk of investor runs and fire sales for precisely the funds that would be most exposed to such hazards. This could reduce the sector's systemic risk. On the other hand, we find that this market-enforced discipline may be weakened by swing pricing - the practice of passing on to purchasing or redeeming shareholders some of the costs of their trading activity by adjusting the fund's net asset value per share. This may reinstate a moral hazard problem.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We examine the incentive of corporate bond fund managers to manipulate portfolio risk in response to competitive pressure. We find that bond funds engage in a reverse fund tournament in which laggard funds actively de-risk their portfolios, trading-off higher yields for more liquid and safer assets. De-risking is stronger for laggard funds that have a more concave sensitivity of flows-to-performance, in periods of market stress, and when bond yields are high. We provide evidence that debt de-risking also reduces ex post liquidation costs by mitigating the investors' incentive to run ex ante. We argue that, in the presence of de-risking behaviors, flexible NAVs (swing pricing) may be counter-productive and induce moral hazard.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Countries around the world use macroprudential policies and capital restrictions as a policy response to volatile capital inflows. This paper asks: are these policies effective in reducing or changing the composition of gross capital inflows, the probability of capital inflow surges, and the probability of currency and banking crises?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The authors assess the effectiveness of policies with a model that takes into account the likelihood that countries will implement a new macroprudential policy or capital control. In particular, they look at macroprudential policies that target foreign currency borrowing and inflows, and compare their effects with those of other macroprudential policies and controls in the following year. They do this for a large sample of countries over nearly two decades, allowing for high-level evidence on effectiveness.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds that capital inflows into countries are lower when those countries use macroprudential policies that target foreign currency, but not after changes in capital controls. Macroprudential policies can also lower the probability of so-called surges in capital inflows, and of banking crises in the following three years. There are no significant effects on the probability of currency crises. There are no significant effects of capital controls. Overall, the results indicate that macroprudential policies - especially those that target foreign currency mismatches - may be more effective at responding to volatile capital inflows than capital controls that discriminate on the basis of residency.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper compares the effectiveness of macroprudential policies (MaPs) and capital controls (CCs) in influencing the volume and composition of capital inflows, and the probability of banking and currency crises. We distinguish between foreign exchange (FX)-based MaPs, which may be similar to some types of CCs, and non-FX-based MaPs. Using a panel of 83 countries over the period 2000-17, and a propensity score matching model to control for selection bias, we find that capital inflow volumes are lower where FX-based MaPs have been activated. The imposition of CCs does not have a significant effect on the volume or composition of capital inflows. Further, we find that the activation of MaPs is associated with a lower probability of banking crises and surges in capital inflows in the following three years.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We investigate how central counterparties (CCPs) manage counterparty credit risks. CCPs play a key role in clearing derivative trades. They stand between clearing members, insuring them against counterparty credit risks. To manage these risks, CCPs ask their clearing members for collateral, ie initial margin. Model risk arises when a CCP underestimates potential credit losses in its initial margin model. If model risk were to materialise at a time of stress, it could lead to the CCP's failure - with systemic consequences.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our contribution is to examine how CCPs might be incentivised to set the initial margin correctly. Incentives matter, because setting the initial margin requires CCPs to make expert judgments. Other parties, such as regulators, lack the information to set them efficiently. We examine three factors that might influence incentives: (i) skin-in-the-game, ie a CCP's own capital, which can be used to cover credit losses; (ii) profits as a proxy for franchise value; and (iii) capital other than skin-in-the-game. We ask how these variables relate to five proxies for model risk: (1) number of margin breaches; (2) achieved coverage; (3) difference between achieved and target coverage; (4) average size of margin breaches; and (5) maximum size of margin breaches.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that a higher amount of skin-in-the-game is associated with a lower degree of model risk. We do not find any similar association between model risk and profits or capital other than skin-in-the-game. The results are robust for all five proxies of model risk.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate empirically how the balance sheet characteristics of central counterparties (CCPs) affect their modelling of credit risk. CCPs set initial margin (IM), i.e., the collateral for transactions, to limit counterparty credit risk. When a CCP's IM model fails on a large scale, the CCP could fail too, losing its skin-in-the-game capital. We find that higher skin-in-the-game is significantly associated with more p rudent modelling, in contrast to profits (a proxy for franchise value) and forms of capital other than skin-in-the-game. The results may help to inform the ongoing policy debate on how to incentivise prudent credit risk management at CCPs.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Information technology (IT) has become indispensable, underpinning economic growth over the past decades. As organisations of all sizes in both the public and private sector become ever more interconnected and reliant on IT products and services such as cloud-based systems and artificial intelligence, they are increasingly exposed to cyber risks - the risk of financial loss, disruption or reputational damage to an organisation resulting from the failure of its IT systems. These episodes include malicious cyber incidents (cyber attacks) where the threat actor intends to do harm (eg ransomware attacks, hacking incidents or data theft by employees).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Cyber incidents are becoming more sophisticated and their costs difficult to quantify. Using a unique database of more than 100,000 cyber events across sectors, we first document the characteristics of cyber incidents and obtain some stylised facts. The richness of the database also lets us examine the relationship between firm-, sector- and event-specific characteristics, and the relative cost of cyber events.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Cyber costs are higher for larger firms and for incidents that affect several organisations at once. The financial sector incurs a larger number of cyber attacks but suffers lower costs, on average, because of its greater investment in IT security. The use of cloud services is associated with lower costs, especially when cyber incidents are relatively small. By contrast, as cloud providers become systemically important, cloud dependence is likely to increase tail risks. Crypto-related activities, which are largely unregulated, are particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Interest in financial cycles has increased sharply in recent years. This paper contrasts and compares analytically and empirically two popular notions: the "domestic financial cycle" (DFC) and the "global financial cycle" (GFCy).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Despite their popularity, there is considerable ambiguity about the two financial cycle notions. As a result, they are sometimes confused. This paper clarifies the similarities and differences. The starting point is that the DFC focuses on how financial conditions within individual countries lead to boom-bust cycles; the GFCy focuses on how global financial conditions affect individual countries. Analytically, the two concepts have a common basis - the ebbs and flows of financial risk-taking and risk avoidance as reflected in funding conditions and asset prices.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The GFCy has a similar duration to that of the business cycle as traditionally measured; the DFC is much longer and is closely related to the large, but typically neglected, medium-term fluctuations in output. While DFCs co-move in some instances, they can also be highly asynchronous; the GFCy is, by definition, global. The two cycles come together around crises, when output declines are largest. Traditional GFCy measures mainly reflect developments in advanced economies; a simple alternative measure is much more relevant for emerging market economies.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We compare and contrast two prominent notions of financial cycles: a domestic variant, which focuses on how financial conditions within individual economies lead to boom-bust cycles there; and a global variant, which highlights how global financial conditions affect individual economies. The two notions share a common analytical basis - the "procyclicality" of the financial system. Yet a number of distinguishing features stand out. These include differences in: (i) the underlying components - financial asset prices and capital flows for the global financial cycle (GFCy) versus credit and property prices for the domestic financial cycle (DFC); (ii) their empirical properties - the GFCy has a shorter duration and is primarily linked with traditional business cycles, while the DFC has a longer duration and is predominantly linked with medium-term business cycles; and (iii) the policy focus - "dilemma versus trilemma" for the GFCy, "lean versus clean" for the DFC. Despite these differences, the two cycles tend to come together around crises. Finally, we show that traditional GFCy measures mainly reflect developments in advanced economies and that a simple alternative measure is much more relevant for emerging market economies.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper uses the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) as a natural experiment to show that sponsor contributions to corporate defined benefit pension funds respond to tax-based incentives. Pension plan sponsors can deduct pension expenses from corporate tax returns. The TCJA cut the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In turn, this cut resulted in a temporary tax break on pension contributions. As a result, sponsors had an incentive to front-load planned future contributions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our results suggest that plan sponsors are not constrained - when setting pension plan strategies - by how much cash they have at hand. Tax-based incentives have a significant impact on the time profile of contributions. However, changes to these incentives do not leave a long-lasting footprint on the level of either sponsor contributions or pension plan solvency.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the TCJA tax break worked exactly as would be expected of a temporary change in tax-based incentives. Sponsors did indeed front-load planned future contributions. In line with the result that the TCJA affected the time profile but not the overall level of sponsor contributions, we find no evidence of a long-lasting impact on plan funding ratios. In contrast with financial press reports of pension fund rebalancing away from equities and into US government bonds during the TCJA tax break in 2017, our estimates show that the TCJA had no impact on plan portfolios. That said, the tax break appears to have narrowed corporate credit spreads.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We document that corporate pension contributions respond to tax-based incentives using the 2017 Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Act (TCJA) as a natural experiment. The TCJA cut the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, temporarily increasing contribution incentives for sponsors of defined-benefit retirement plans. We exploit cross-sectional variation in ex-ante exposure to these incentives. We find that the tax break induced an extra $3 billion of sponsor contributions to medium- and large-scale plans in 2017. But we also find strong evidence of a reversal, both in terms of sponsor contributions and plan funding ratios by 2018. We find no evidence of impact on plan asset allocations. Our results suggest that the TCJA did not have a long-lasting impact on corporate defined-benefit pension funds.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Are banks, or financial intermediaries more generally, inherently unstable and prone to volatility? Historically, even some of the staunchest proponents of laissez-faire such as Milton Friedman have viewed banking as inherently unstable and hence requiring government intervention.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the logical possibility that financial intermediation might be inherently unstable. We remain agnostic and do not suppose a priori that financial intermediation engenders instability - or even if it does, we do not know if this is inherent in such activities or induced by policymakers' interventions. There is no generally accepted and all-purpose model of financial intermediaries to study this question, because these institutions perform a myriad of functions that are difficult to capture in a single setup. They serve as middlemen between savers and borrowers or asset sellers and buyers; they find, screen and monitor investment opportunities on behalf of depositors; and they provide liquidity insurance or maturity transformation, etc. So we analyse several formal models capturing the different facets of intermediation, as we want to know which ones, if any, lead to instability.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find in each case that financial intermediaries can indeed engender instability: an economy with these institutions is more likely to have volatile dynamics than the same economy without them. In some cases, without intermediation the economy is stable, but with it becomes volatile; in others, intermediation expands the set of parameters for which the economy displays volatility. While the logic differs across models, in each case instability is directly related to the raison d'être for intermediation. Yet, while financial intermediation may be fragile in this sense, we emphasise that it still tends to increase welfare.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Are financial intermediaries inherently unstable and, if so, why? To address this, we analyse whether model economies with financial intermediation are particularly prone to multiple, cyclic or stochastic equilibria. Several formalisations are considered: a dynamic version of Diamond-Dybvig banking incorporating reputational considerations; a model with fixed costs and delegated investment as in Diamond; one with bank liabilities serving as payment instruments similar to currency in Lagos-Wright; and one with intermediaries as dealers in decentralised asset markets, similar to Duffie et al. Although the economics and mathematics differ across specifications, in each case financial intermediation engenders instability in a precise sense.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Many financial markets operate through dealers, market-makers, or similar intermediaries that promote liquidity in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Following the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09, clearing of standard derivatives contracts through a central counterparty (CCP) became mandatory. Through novation, CCP clearing reduces counterparty risk and reinforces market liquidity and stability. However, the effects of these reforms on the structure of the markets in which they are implemented have been little studied.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We analyse the effects of introducing measures aimed at reducing counterparty risk on dealers' entry/exit, the market share of each dealer, liquidity measured by bid-ask spreads, and the overall welfare of dealers and end users in normal times. Also, we analyse the impact of adopting these measures on the incentives of dealers to innovate in better market-making technologies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>One may expect that initiatives aimed at reducing counterparty risk would bring uncontested benefits. In line with the theory of the second best, we show that such initiatives could to some extent "backfire" - for example, dealers can have too little incentives to innovate in more efficient market-making activities. The reason is intuitive: reducing counterparty risk for all lowers cost and opens up entry to less efficient dealers. More entry improves liquidity by reducing the bid-ask spread. However, this lowers rents, thus reducing the incentives of dealers to innovate in the first place. Welfare could decrease. When accounting for the desirability of CCP clearing, its benefits for the financial system should compensate for the loss of efficiency due to, for example, a lack of innovation.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We develop a parsimonious model to study the effect of regulations aimed at reducing counterparty risk on the structure of over-the-counter securities markets. We find that such regulations promote entry of dealers, thus fostering competition and lowering spreads. Greater competition, however, has an indirect negative effect on market-making profitability. General equilibrium effects imply that more competition can distort incentives of all dealers to invest in efficient technologies ex ante, and so can cause a social welfare loss. Our results are consistent with empirical findings on the effects of post-crisis regulations and with the opposition of some market participants to those regulations.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies how US dollar invoicing and the rise of global value chains (GVCs) affects the relationship between monetary policy, exchange rates and international trade.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We build a three-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model where two small open economies trade with each other as well as with a large global economy (representing the United States). All the economies export final goods to each other. In addition, the two small economies operate a GVC by exporting intermediate goods to one another that are processed further before shipping the final product to the US. We study how different segments of international trade (final goods vs GVCs) react to exchange rate movements triggered by monetary shocks. We test the predictions of the model using a granular decomposition of bilateral trade flows into the source, intermediate and final destinations of value added.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In response to both domestic and foreign shocks, the model has notably different implications for final goods trade, on the one hand, and GVC-oriented trade, on the other. For example, in response to a US monetary contraction and dollar appreciation, final goods trade between non-US countries declines by more than the GVC trade that services US final demand. The evidence in favour of the main predictions of the model is ambiguous when we consider only a coarse classification between final and intermediate goods trade that is available in standard databases. However, we find much stronger evidence for the model once we use input-output data to generate measures that capture GVC activity more accurately. These findings highlight the importance of acknowledging GVCs in economic modelling, data collection efforts and empirical investigations.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Recent literature has highlighted that international trade is mostly priced in a few key vehicle currencies, and is increasingly dominated by intermediate goods and global value chains (GVCs). Taking these features into account, this paper reexamines the business cycle dynamics of international trade and its relationship with monetary policy and exchange rates. Using a three country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework, it finds key differences between the response of final goods and GVC trade to both internal and external shocks. In particular, the model shows that in response to a dollar appreciation triggered by a US interest rate increase, direct bilateral trade between non-US countries contracts more than global value chain oriented trade which feeds US final demand. We use granular data on GVC at the sector level to document empirical evidence in favor of this prediction. </p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We review the bank and CCP international regulatory reforms implemented after the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). The reforms have sought to bolster financial stability through both improved and new standards.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We ground the review on a unified analytical framework. The key notion is "shock-absorbing capacity". The framework allows us to discuss both individual "trees" (standards) and how they come together to shape the regulatory "forest".</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, the post-GFC reforms have greatly strengthened the financial system. They have improved the quantity, quality and timeliness of the loss-absorbing resources supporting financial stability; they have increased the robustness of standards to mismeasurement and misreporting of risks; and they have addressed systemic ("macroprudential") concerns head-on. Second, the system's shock-absorbing capacity depends strongly on how individual standards interact, in some cases reinforcing each other, in others giving rise to tensions. Third, there still are "barren patches", or areas that deserve authorities' further attention. This reinforces the need for a conservative regulatory approach.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper reviews post-crisis financial regulatory reforms, examines how they fit together and identifies open issues. Specifically, it takes stock of the salient new features of bank and CCP international standards within a unified analytical framework. The key notion in this framework is "shock-absorbing capacity", which is higher when (i) there is less exposure to the losses that a shock generates and (ii) there are more resources to absorb such losses. How do the reforms strengthen this capacity, individually and as a package? Which areas merit further attention? We argue that, given the political economy pressures and technical obstacles that the reforms have faced, as well as the inherent uncertainty about the reforms' effects, it is important to maintain a conservative regulatory approach. A higher cost of balance sheet space is a healthy side effect of the backstops underpinning such an approach.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the relationship between bank geographic complexity and risk. We use a unique dataset of 96 bank holding companies around the world to measure the geographic dispersion of their affiliates. We study how this dispersion interacts with economic and regulatory conditions to affect the riskiness of the bank.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Global banks' complexity is a major concern for policy makers, since it can make banks more opaque and harder to resolve. Yet, bank complexity is not a clearly defined concept, and its link with risk is not straightforward. We build a global database from which we derive a measure of bank geographic complexity across time and countries. This measure is distinct from and complements existing measures. It allows us to study the link between bank geographic complexity and risk in many economic and regulatory settings.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that geographic complexity has a Janus face, decreasing some aspects of bank risk but increasing others. Banks with a greater geographic spread are better insulated from domestic economic shocks. However, they are more exposed to global shocks. In addition, prudential regulation has a weaker impact on banks that are more geographically complex.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the relationship between bank geographic complexity and risk using a unique dataset of 96 global bank holding companies (BHCs) over 2008-2016. From data on the affiliate network of internationally active banking entities, we construct a measure of geographic coverage and complexity for each BHC. We find that higher geographic complexity heightens banks' capacity to absorb local economic shocks, reducing their risk. However, higher geographic complexity is also associated with a higher vulnerability to global shocks and less impact of prudential regulation, increasing their risk. Geographic complexity helps more (with respect to local shocks) and hurts less (with respect to global shocks) if countries' business cycles are misaligned. Large, international regulatory reforms such as the implementation of the GSIB framework and the European Single Supervisory Mechanism reduce bank risk, but geographic complexity weakens this effect. Bank geographic complexity therefore has a Janus face, decreasing some but increasing other aspects of bank risk.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We explore how corporate borrowing is affected worldwide when banks come under pressure to reduce their lending. Starting with a cross-country data set for firms that depend on banks for their funding, we enhance the data on firms' capital structure using data on syndicated loans and bond. Then we ask if the borrowings of US firms from banks, non-bank lenders and bond markets change after the European Banking Authority increased its capital requirements for banks in 2011. We focus on two major types of bank lending: credit line commitments and bank loans.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>International bank lending tends to expand and contract both frequently and abruptly. In this paper, we study such fluctuations in detail, to investigate whether they lead to cuts in bank credit line commitments or term loans. Further, we explore if domestic credit markets cushion these shocks and, if so, what relative roles are played by their two main segments: the corporate bond and loan markets. The use of syndicated loan data allows us to explore the role of non-bank financial intermediaries in the loan market.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>As suggested by previous literature, we find that banks cut their international lending when faced with pressure to cut lending. Our first novel finding is to show that this contraction in international lending focuses more on credit lines, which dry up, than on bank term loans, which remain resilient. Firms secure credit lines from non-bank financial intermediaries, and do not increase bond issuance. Taken together, our results suggest that a diversified domestic loan market, including non-bank financial institutions, can help to cushion cuts in international lending.  </p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using a cross-country sample of bank-dependent public firms we study the international spillovers of a change in banking regulation on corporate borrowing. For identification we examine how US firms' liabilities vis-à-vis banks, non-bank lenders and bond markets evolve after an increase in capital requirements implemented by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in 2011. We find that US firms experience a reduction in credit lines but not in term loans from EU banks. In addition, US firms are able to compensate for the reduction in credit lines from EU banks by securing liquidity facilities from US non-bank financial institutions, without increasing borrowing from corporate bond markets. These results suggest that diversified domestic loan markets, with both banks and non-bank financial institutions providing loans to corporations, can help overcome cuts in cross-border bank funding.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The financial system is a public good, with banks at their heart. Shocks that hit one bank tend to spill over to other banks, and can cause a cascade of effects through to the whole economy. The more systemically important a bank is, the larger these spillovers are likely to be. More systemically important banks are therefore generally required to hold additional capital to reduce the overall riskiness of the banking system.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></h4>
<p>We first estimate the size of spillovers between the volatility of equity prices in one bank and those in other banks. We then look to see if this is related to how systemically important the different banks are. We focus on the world's most systemically important banks, as identified by the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find a strong link between the size of volatility spillovers and how systemically important a bank is. We also find that banks with more capital have smaller spillovers to other banks, and the effect is stronger for more systemically important banks. Our results provide support for current policy, where higher capital standards for more systemically important banks help to reduce the riskiness of the banking system.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We assess the dynamics of volatility spillovers among global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). We measure spillovers using vector-autoregressive models of range volatility of the equity prices of G-SIBs, together with machine learning methods. We then compare the size of these spillovers with the degree of systemic importance measured by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's G-SIB bucket designations. We find a high positive correlation between the two. We also find that higher bank capital<br/>reduces volatility spillovers, especially for banks in higher G-SIB buckets. Our results suggest that requiring banks that are designated as being more systemically important globally to hold additional capital is likely to reduce volatility spillovers from them to other large banks.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper estimates the effects of monetary policy in the United States, the euro area and Japan when short-term interest rates are near zero or even negative, ie their effective lower bound (ELB). The ELB periods extend from January 2009 to December 2015 for the US economy, since July 2012 for the euro area, and since January 1996 for Japan. That monetary policy would be effective in such conditions is not a given, as the central bank can no longer lower interest rates to spur credit, asset prices and economic activity. This analysis is important because interest rates may remain at or near their ELB in the decade ahead.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></h4>
<p>In this article, we estimate the effect of monetary policy shocks in situations where the short-term interest rate is near its ELB and compare these estimates with the ones obtained in "normal times", ie in previous periods when the short-term interest rate fluctuated at positive levels. We present and discuss state-of-the-art (Bayesian (structural vector autoregressive) identification) estimates that are consistent for the United States, the euro area and Japan.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that monetary policy has remained fairly effective in stimulating output and inflation in spite of the proximity of short-term interest rates to their ELB. Increases in the supply of money by the central bank work their way through the credit channel. These results are consistent for the United States, the euro area and Japan. We find very little evidence, at least so far, that lower levels of short-term interest rates have made monetary policy impotent. There is little backing in the data for a "liquidity trap" that would be relevant at the macroeconomic level.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The liquidity trap is synonymous with ineffective monetary policy. The common wisdom is that, as the short-term interest rate nears its effective lower bound, monetary policy cannot do much to stimulate the economy. However, central banks have resorted to alternative instruments, such as QE, credit easing and forward guidance. Using state-of- the-art estimates of the effects of monetary policy, we show that monetary easing stimulates output and inflation, also during the period when short-term interest rates are near their lower bound. These results are consistent across the United States, the euro area and Japan.</p>

<p><em>Note: This paper and appendix (see further below) have been updated as of 25 November 2020. It was originally published under the title "A New Indicator of Bank Funding Cost".</em></p>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper describes the construction of a new indicator of bank funding stress in both dollars and euros. The Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 has changed the way money markets function, and banks have since been subject to rollover risk. In other words, there is a difference between the bank offered rate at a given tenor (ie the frequency of payments agreed between counterparties) and the rollover of overnight interest swap rates with the same maturity. While this rollover risk is typically measured by the spot IBOR-OIS spread, we obtain a more complete picture of banks' current and expected funding stress by measuring the market expectation of future IBOR-OIS spreads.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></h4>
<p>We build forward IBOR-OIS spreads, which we call forward funding spreads (FFS), using transaction data from dollar and euro interest rates of various maturities. Our FFS are consistent in terms of the underlying tenors associated with the interest rate contracts. This is important because different frequencies of payments imply different underlying rollover risks. These FFS, which are daily indicators of expected funding stress, are made available online in an appendix to this paper.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that FFS are useful in at least two respects. First, they provide central banks with an indication of the market perception of bank funding stress and its persistence. In crisis times, the FFS is typically narrower than the spot IBOR-OIS, which is consistent with market participants' expectation that funding stress will be short-lived. We actually characterise liquidity regimes (crisis, moderate and abundant) that are correlated with the levels of excess liquidity supplied by either the Federal Reserve or the ECB. We show, in particular, how liquidity regimes strongly impacted the FFS's response to the Covid-19 pandemic on both sides of the Atlantic. Second, FFS are also better predictors of economic and banking activity than alternative spreads either on rollover risk or on credit risk. This is consistent with the view that bank funding stress can influence macroeconomic outcomes only if market participants expect them to persist.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Designing operations for liquidity support requires central banks to properly measure and monitor bank funding risk in real time. We construct a new indicator of rollover risk for banks, called the forward funding spread. By accounting for market participants' expectations of how funding costs will evolve over time, it serves as a better signal of the change in the stance of monetary policy than the usual spot InterBank Offered Rate-Overnight Interest Swap spread. Our indicator helps to contrast three liquidity regimes, which coincide with the levels of excess liquidity supplied by central banks.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study whether prudential policies enacted in one country affect banks' lending to other countries, and how monetary policy affects these spillovers. We distinguish between the policies enacted by a bank's home country (where it is headquartered) and a bank's host country (where it operates). To do so, we develop a novel approach that separates cross-border bank lending into the home and host parts and matches them with home and host policies.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></h4>
<p>Banks face an overlay of regulations applied by their home country and their host country. There is little research on how these regulatory layers relate to each other. Our paper looks at the effects of home and host regulation (jointly and separately) on cross-border lending in a large sample. We further contribute a new empirical framework that can be used more broadly for related issues.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that prudential policies do produce spillovers through cross-border bank lending. The effect depends on the instrument used and whether the home or host regulator implemented the policy. Home policies tend to have larger effects, and US monetary policy can affect the magnitude of these spillovers.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Prudential regulation of banks is multi-layered: policy changes by home-country authorities affect banks' global operations across many jurisdictions; changes by host-country authorities shape banks' operations in the host jurisdiction regardless of the nationality of the parent bank. Which layer matters most? Do these policies create cross-border spillovers? And how does monetary policy alter these spillovers? This paper examines the effect that changes in home- and hostcountry prudential measures have on cross-border credit, and how these interact with monetary policy. We use a novel approach to decompose growth in cross-border bank lending into separate home, host and common components, and then match each with the home or host policies that affect this component. Our results suggest that prudential policies can have spillover effects, which depend on the instrument used and on whether a bank's home or host country implemented them. Home policies tend to have larger spillovers on cross-border US dollar lending than host policies, primarily through substitution effects. We also find that a tightening of US monetary policy can compound the spillovers of certain prudential measures.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the effects of average inflation targeting (AIT) on macroeconomic stabilisation in the presence of a lower bound. AIT has recently attracted increasing attention as a possible alternative to currently prevailing inflation targeting frameworks, notably because of its "make-up" feature, whereby past inflation shortfalls are made up for by temporarily higher future inflation and vice versa.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></p>
<p>Our paper contributes to the ongoing discussion of the benefits and costs of alternative monetary policy strategies. We consider the optimisation problem of a central bank whose objective function features the volatility of average inflation rates over a prespecified time period, as opposed to the current inflation rate. Our analysis is based on two variants of the standard New Keynesian model with an interest rate lower bound, one with rational expectations and one with boundedly rational expectations.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that AIT improves welfare considerably when agents form expectations rationally. Following a large recessionary shock that drives the policy rate to the lower bound, a central bank with an AIT objective engineers a temporary overshooting in future inflation that helps to mitigate the decline of output and inflation at the lower bound via the expectations channel. Under rational expectations, the optimal averaging window is infinitely long, which implies that optimal AIT is equivalent to price level targeting. However, we find that most of the welfare improvement associated with the optimal AIT can be attained by an AIT objective with a finite, but sufficiently long, averaging window. The results from the rational expectations model are robust to including plausible degrees of bounded rationality. However, if cognitive limitations are sufficiently large, the optimal averaging window is finite and the welfare gains from adopting AIT can be small.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Assigning a discretionary central bank a mandate to stabilize an average inflation rate - rather than a period-by-period inflation rate - increases welfare in a New Keynesian model with an occasionally binding lower bound on nominal interest rates. Under rational expectations, the welfare-maximizing averaging window is infinitely long, which means that optimal average inflation targeting (AIT) is equivalent to price level targeting (PLT). However, AIT with a finite, but sufficiently long, averaging window can attain most of the welfare gain from PLT. Under boundedly-rational expectations, if cognitive limitations are sufficiently strong, the optimal averaging window is finite, and the welfare gain of adopting AIT can be small.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How can the Federal Reserve manage a global dollar money market that opens for business while US markets are closed? Many accounts of central bank cooperation assume that this question was first posed during the Great Financial Crisis in 2007-08. Then, the Fed offered foreign exchange swaps to selected European central banks to allow them to lend dollars to banks in their own markets before New York opened. Was this the first time that the Fed had tried to stabilise the offshore dollar market in this way?</p>
<p><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></p>
<p>We profile the Federal Reserve's swap lines since 1962. We consult not only Fed sources, but also Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and Bank for International Settlements archives. We provide the first systematic analysis of the Fed's eurodollar operations in the 1960s through swap lines. The BIS served the Fed as an operating arm, taking credit risk as it placed eurodollar deposits to stabilise offshore dollar yields in advance of year- or quarter-end window-dressing. While short-lived, these operations have a very modern ring.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We draw out four themes. First, swaps had a sustained pre-history from 1962 to 1998, surviving the transition from fixed to floating exchange rates. Second, the Fed wove its swaps into a wider net of central bank swap lines. Third, the Fed's eurodollar operations contradict the view that swaps in the 1960s solely managed exchange rates and not Libor. Fourth, this earlier cooperation underscores the Fed's use of swaps to keep eurodollar strains from blocking the transmission of its domestic monetary policy. In all likelihood, the US interest in the eurodollar market, and thus the Fed's self-interest in central bank cooperation, will not end even when Libor ceases to benchmark costs for US loans and mortgages.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper explores the record of central bank swaps to draw out four themes. First, this recent device of central bank cooperation had a sustained pre-history from 1962-1998, surviving the transition from fixed to floating exchange rates. Second, Federal Reserve swap facilities have generally formed a part of a wider network of central bank swap lines. Third, we take issue with the view of swaps as previously used only to manage exchange rates and only more recently to manage offshore funding liquidity and yields. In particular, we spotlight how in the 1960s the Federal Reserve, working in conjunction with the BIS and European central banks, repeatedly used swaps to manage eurodollar funding liquidity and Libor yields. BIS, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank archives show an intention to offset seasonal disturbances to funding liquidity in order to prevent eurodollar yield spikes. Fourth, this earlier cooperation underscores the Federal Reserve's use of swaps to prevent eurodollar shortages from interfering with the transmission of its domestic monetary policy. The US interest in the eurodollar market, and thus its self interest in central bank cooperation, is unlikely to end even when Libor is replaced as the benchmark for US floating-rate loans and mortgages.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>A broad appreciation of the dollar dampens international trade by weighing on the operation of credit-intensive global value chains (GVCs). </p>
<h4>Contributions</h4>
<p>We are accustomed to drawing an automatic link between exchange rates and export performance through the textbook trade competitiveness channel according to which a strong US dollar boosts exports of non-US economies. Paradoxically, a strong dollar may actually serve to dampen trade volumes, rather than stimulate them.</p>
<p>A detailed empirical analysis using 4.6 million observations of export shipments by product category shows that when dollar credit conditions tighten, firms that rely more on wholesale dollar-funded banks suffer a greater contraction in exports. This is due to greater stringency in access to working capital to sustain GVCs. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, following an appreciation of the dollar, banks with high reliance on dollar wholesale funding reduce supply of dollar credit more relative to banks with low wholesale dollar funding exposures.</p>
<p>Second, firms that are more exposed to wholesale dollar-funded banks (and hence suffer a decline in credit supply), experience a slowdown in exports, controlling for non-credit factors.</p>
<p>Third, the exports of firms that have higher working capital needs and are part of longer production chains are hit more by the dollar appreciation.</p>
<p>Taken together, the findings point to the trade suppressing effect of dollar appreciation working through the global bank credit channel. Our findings are consistent with the conventional trade competitiveness channel in that we also observe the positive effect on exports deriving from the trade competitiveness channel, but only in those firms that borrow from banks that are less exposed to dollar wholesale funding, or are not exposed at all.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The strength of the US dollar has attributes of a barometer of dollar credit conditions, with a stronger dollar associated with tighter dollar credit conditions. Using finely disaggregated data on export shipments, we find that following a dollar appreciation exporters that are more reliant on dollar-funded bank credit for working capital suffer a greater decline in credit and slowdown in exports, including those into the United States. Our findings shed light on the role of the US dollar in the interaction between financial globalization and international trade.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates the overall effect of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) implemented since 2008 on euro area bank retail lending and deposit rates offered to households and non-financial corporations. To do so, we use an analytical approach that combines the estimation of the cumulative effects of UMP on key money and capital market rates via daily event study analysis with monthly retail rate pass-through estimation. In counterfactual simulations, we quantify the full effect of the ECB's UMPs implemented since 2008 on retail lending and deposit rates and systematically explore differences in their effects over time and across euro area countries. Our results show that the ECB's UMPs - particularly the measures launched since 2012 - significantly lowered retail lending and deposit rates in Germany, France, Spain and in particular in Italy. The impact on banks' intermediation margins through retail lending-deposit rate spreads turns out to be not clear-cut, with significant compressions prevailing only in Germany and Italy.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central banks are playing an increasingly active role in promoting the move towards a sustainable global economy. One area in which they are thus involved is in guiding attempts to mobilise funds to contribute to the large-scale public sector investment required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key tool in this context is foreign exchange reserves, with green bonds being an increasingly popular investment choice among reserve managers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-size: 1.125rem;">Contribution</span></p>
<p>In this paper, we explore how central banks might expand the usual triad of objectives - liquidity, safety and return - to fit environmental sustainability considerations into their reserve management frameworks. This can be done either by explicitly articulating sustainability as a defined purpose of holding reserves, or implicitly as a supporting aspect of existing policy purposes. In each case, this will involve additional trade-offs. We assess these, based on the example of green bonds.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that sustainability objectives can be integrated into reserve management frameworks without forgoing safety and return. Indeed, the results of an illustrative portfolio construction exercise suggest that adding green bonds to a conventional bond portfolio allows reserve managers to improve their reserves' risk profile without sacrificing expected return. This is explained mainly by diversification benefits.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Central banks' frameworks for managing foreign reserves have traditionally balanced a triad of objectives: liquidity, safety and return. Pursuing these objectives involves explicit trade-offs. More of an emphasis on returns, for instance, may require central banks to sacrifice some of the safety and liquidity of their overall holdings. Most recently, central banks have shown significant interest in incorporating environmental sustainability considerations into their policy frameworks, including their reserve management. This paper first explores whether sustainability considerations would support a tetrad of reserve management objectives, by drawing on the results of a recent BIS Survey on Reserve Management and Sustainability. It then illustrates how central banks might analyse (and weigh) all four objectives in allocating part of their foreign exchange reserves to green bonds using currently available market data.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>A bank's net interest rate margin (NIM) is the difference between the interest it receives on its assets and the interest it pays on its liabilities, divided by the amount of its interest-bearing assets. In general, a decreasing level of market interest rates compresses the NIM. But does the effect of a change in the interest rate on the NIM also depend on whether the interest rate level is negative instead of low and positive? And what is the impact of a shrinking NIM on lending?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Using two proprietary bank-level data sets, I analyse the impact of the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in the euro area on banks' NIM. I then investigate the effect of the NIM on new lending. Furthermore, as a stronger impact of negative rates on the NIM could result from an effective zero lower bound in banks' retail deposit rates, the NIM is decomposed into the lending and deposit rates.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>I find that the short-term market rate is positively related to euro area banks' NIM, but only up to an interest rate level of about 2%. Its impact increases with declining interest rates. The difference between negative interest rates and low but positive interest rates is not only statistically significant but also economically relevant. In particular, at negative market rates, a 1 percentage point decrease in the short-term interest rate implies a reduction in the monthly NIM by 3.2% relative to the sample mean, compared with 1.2% at low but positive rates. The pushing factor behind the increasing impact at negative market rates is the stronger reaction of the lending rate compared with the virtually unchanged reaction of the deposit rate. Considering the entire sample period, a falling NIM has a negative effect on new lending. However, for the period of negative rates, this effect cannot be confirmed empirically.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper explores the impact of low (but) positive and negative market interest rates on euro area banks' net interest margin (NIM) and its components, retail lending and retail deposit rates. Using two proprietary bank-level data sets, I find a positive impact of the level of the short-term rate on the NIM, which increases substantially at negative market rates. As low profitability could hamper the ability of banks to expand lending, I also investigate the impact of the NIM on new lending to the non-financial private sector. In general, the NIM is positively related to lending: When lending is less profitable, banks cut lending. However, at negative rates this effect vanishes. This finding suggests that banks adjusted their business practices when servicing new loans, thereby contributing to higher new lending in the euro area since 2014.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper studies how financial conditions affect real economic activity. It examines, in particular, the relationship between the role of the dollar exchange rate and indicators compiled from surveys of corporate purchasing activity around the world, as well as indicators of global trade growth. A special focus is on how this relationship has evolved since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) compared with the pre-crisis period.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Financial conditions affect real economic activity, and this relationship has changed since the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09, not least because of significant changes that have taken place in the pattern of financial intermediation. Our paper contributes to the literature examining the greater role of the dollar as a determinant of global economic activity. It sheds light on this issue by examining how changes in the financial sector since the GFC have influenced the empirical relationship between global purchasing managers' indices, world trade and indicators of global financial conditions, with a special focus on the broad dollar exchange rate index.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We find that the relationship between financial market variables and real economic activity has changed since the GFC. The influence of the dollar on global manufacturing and trade has increased, while that of the implied volatility embedded in equity options has decreased. In addition, the relationship between the dollar and real activity has changed: since the GFC, a stronger dollar has been associated with weaker trade and manufacturing outside the United States, contrary to pre-crisis experience and the theory of trade competitiveness. We review several explanations for these results, focusing on changes in financial intermediation since the GFC and the role of dollar financing for firms participating in global supply chains.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The interest in how financial conditions affect real economic activity has grown since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), not least because some of the mechanisms at play in the financial sector may have changed. We shed light on this issue by examining the empirical relationship between global Purchasing Managers' Indices, world trade and indicators of global financial conditions, with a special focus on the broad dollar index. We show that the influence of the dollar on real economic activity and global trade seems to have increased since the GFC, while that of the VIX has decreased.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Growth and productivity are persistently low following financial crises. This paper examines how financial crises affect innovation. Patents are an important measure of the kind of innovative activity that can lead to productivity gains. We study patent data from a broad sample of countries and financial crises and consider impacts up to 10 years after a crisis.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This is the first cross-country study on how financial crises affect patenting. Our sample includes crisis episodes of different types across many different countries. This allows us to establish general patterns connecting financial crises and innovative activity. We distinguish between types of crises and recessions to understand these outcomes better.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Some industries are more reliant on external funding, such as from banks, to finance their activities. We find that these industries decrease their patenting more following a financial crisis than other industries. The effect is persistent, lasting upwards of 10 years, and is specific to banking crises. This indicates that when firms lose access to bank credit, they may be forced to drop new and ongoing R&amp;D projects. This results in fewer patents over the following years. These results provide a link between financial crises and the sustained decline in output and productivity observed after a recession.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Financial crises are accompanied by permanent drops in economic growth and output. Technological progress and innovation are important drivers of economic growth. This paper studies how financial crises affect innovative activities. Using cross-country panel data on patenting at the industry-level, we identify a financial channel whereby disruptions in financial markets impact patenting activity. Specifically, we find that patenting decreases more following banking crises for industries that are more dependent on external finance. This financial channel is not at play during currency crises, sovereign debt crises, or recessions more generally, suggesting that disruption in banking activity matters for investment in innovative activities. The effect on patenting is economically large and long-lasting, resulting in less patenting, in terms of both total quantity and quality, for 10 years or longer after a banking crisis. The average patent quality, however, does not appear to decline. We show the results are not likely to be driven by reverse causality or omitted variables. These findings provide a link between banking crises and the observed patterns of lower long-term growth. Liquidity support in the aftermath of banking crises appears to help reduce the effects through the financial channel over the short term.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper asks whether the syndicated loan portfolio of banks in the United States reacted differently to the regulatory change for deposit insurance in 2011. The increase in the insurance fee levied on banks to fund the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's fund had varying effects among US banks, increasing the cost of wholesale funding for insured domestic banks, while reducing it for uninsured foreign bank branches. This might have affected the credit supply at insured banks and uninsured foreign banks in differing ways.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper contributes to the discussion on the role of foreign banks in credit creation, especially in a country like the United States where foreign banks also have a crucial role in managing US dollar-based money market operations at the group level. The literature has already shown that foreign banks which benefited from the favourable funding shock reacted by increasing their reserves holdings. Our paper seeks to investigate more deeply the effect on the syndicated loan market. To do this, we use a data set at the bank-firm level that was obtained by hand-matching data from the syndicated loan market with banks' balance sheet data. The data set's granularity lets us better quantify the effects of the policy-driven liquidity shock on the loan supply.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The paper finds that uninsured foreign banks, which met with a relatively positive funding shock, did engage in liquidity hoarding. Hence, they accumulated more reserves but extended fewer total syndicated loans. They also became more passive in the syndicated loan deals in which they participated. These results are robust even after controlling for the effects of the European debt crisis and other home country-specific shocks.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We empirically assess the responses of banks in the United States to a regulatory change that influenced the distribution of funding in the banking system. Following the 2011 FDIC change in the assessment base, insured banks found wholesale funding more costly, while uninsured branches of foreign banks enjoyed cheaper access to wholesale liquidity. We use quarterly bank balance sheet data and a rich data set of syndicated loans with borrower and lender characteristics to show that uninsured foreign banks, which faced a relatively positive shock, engaged in liquidity hoarding. Hence, they accumulated more reserves but extended fewer total syndicated loans and became more passive in the syndicated loan deals in which they participated. These results contribute to the discussion on the role of foreign banks in credit creation, especially in a country like the United States where foreign banks also have a crucial role in managing USD money market operations at the group level.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The pre-crisis regulatory framework provided banks with a large degree of discretion in determining their capital requirements. This resulted in excessive variability in banks' capital requirements, which ultimately undermined the credibility of the risk-weighted capital framework at the peak of the global financial crisis. The Basel III post-crisis reforms developed by the Basel Committee seek to reduce this variability. How successful will they be in achieving this outcome?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper develops a new approach to measuring variability in banks' risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which compares a market-implied estimate of a bank's risk profile with the bank's own estimate. This variability ratio provides an external benchmark to assess the degree of difference in modelled capital requirements across banks and over time. It also provides a quantitative measure to assess the extent to which this difference has narrowed as a result of the Basel III reforms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Over the period 2001 to 16, there was a wide degree of RWA variability among banks. Market-implied RWA estimates were higher than those modelled by banks.</p>
<p>What drove this variability? We find a significant association between the degree of RWA variability and (i) the share of opaque assets held by banks (eg derivatives); (ii) the degree to which a bank is constrained by its capital requirements; and (iii) jurisdiction-specific factors. Put differently, market participants 'penalise' banks with such features relative to other banks.</p>
<p>And what about Basel III? We find that the 2017 Basel III reforms - most notably the output floor - help to reduce excessive RWA variability.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The global financial crisis highlighted a number of weaknesses in the regulatory framework, including concerns about excessive variability in banks' risk-weighted assets (RWAs) stemming from their use of internal models. The Basel III reforms that were finalised in 2017 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision seek to reduce this excessive RWA variability. This paper develops a novel approach to measuring RWA variability - the variability ratio - by comparing a market-implied measure of RWAs with banks' reported regulatory RWAs. Using a panel data set comprising a large sample of internationally-active banks over the period 2001 to 16, we find that there was a wide degree of RWA variability among banks, and that market-implied RWA estimates were persistently higher than regulatory RWAs. We then assess the determinants of this variability, and find a strong and statistically-significant association between our measure of RWA variability and (i) the share of opaque assets held by banks (eg derivatives); (ii) the degree to which a bank is capital constrained; and (iii) jurisdiction-specific factors. These results suggest that market participants may be applying an 'opaqueness' premium for banks that hold highly-complex instruments, and that the incentive for banks to game their internal models is particularly acute for capital-constrained banks. The results also point to the importance of jurisdiction-specific factors in explaining RWA variability. In addition, we find that RWA variability directly affects banks' own profitability through higher funding costs. Finally, we find that the 2017 Basel III reforms - most notably the output floor - help to reduce excessive RWA variability.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Non-US firms issue dollar bonds because of their business needs or to benefit from potential funding opportunities (lower funding costs). Firms with dollar revenues or long-term assets need to issue dollar-denominated debt to hedge their exchange rate exposures. Also, the strong demand for assets denominated in dollars after the Great Financial Crisis created favourable market conditions for non-US firms that sought to issue dollar bonds.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In this paper, we explore how firms respond to dollar funding opportunities depending on their specific characteristics using a novel data set at the firm level. Our major contribution is to analyse whether firms' response to cost-saving opportunities is influenced by two crucial characteristics: their asset-side exposures to the dollar and their credit risk.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that firms increase their dollar borrowings when the corporate basis (the relative cost of local to synthetic currency borrowing) widens. However, not all firms increase dollar borrowing alike. Firms with very strong credit ratings issue more dollar bonds especially when dollar funding opportunities appear, exploiting the fact that they can offer investors close substitutes for safe dollar assets. Firms with higher dollar revenues or more long-term assets in dollars do not react to changes in dollar funding costs, although their share of dollar borrowing always remains high due to their operational needs for dollar funding. Altogether, the composition of dollar borrowers shifts when the corporate basis widens, as high-grade firms gain importance, relative to firms with operational needs.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We explore the link between firms' dollar bond borrowing and their FX-hedged funding opportunities, as reflected in a positive corporate basis (the relative cost of local to synthetic currency borrowing). Consistent with previous research, we first document that firms substitute domestic for dollar borrowing when they have higher dollar revenues or long-term assets and when the corporate basis widens. Importantly, our novel firm-level dataset enables to show that when these funding opportunities appear, the currency substitution is stronger for very high-grade firms, as they can offer to investors close substitutes for safe dollar assets. However, firms with higher dollar revenues or long-term assets do not react to changes in the corporate basis. Altogether, the composition of dollar borrowers shifts when the basis widens, as very high-grade firms gain importance, relative to firms with operational needs.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>As they collect and process detailed consumer data, financial firms get better at designing products that serve their customers' needs and preferences. However, these skills also create scope for firms to exploit consumers' fallibilities or "biases", such as limited attention to detail and/or short-termism ("myopia"). This paper investigates whether this is actually the case in the US credit card market.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Credit card contracts differ significantly in how far they emphasise back-loaded or front-loaded terms. For instance, some cards offer low introductory rates coupled with high late-payment fees, while others charge higher but uniform annual fees. Back-loaded terms can be attractive for customers with low credit limits, but issuers may also use such terms to extract higher fee income from less perceptive ("myopic") customers. The paper provides evidence for card issuers' strategies by analysing 1.3 million credit card offer letters in the United States.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper shows that issuers do seek to exploit behavioural biases. To this end, they highlight attractive front-loaded features, while "shrouding" unattractive back-loaded features. They do this by placing information more or less prominently, and by adjusting the font size or complexity of language. Moreover, in the case of less-educated consumers, for whom returns on shrouding are likely to be higher, issuers use shrouded back-loaded features more heavily. In principle, such a strategy could result in potentially higher credit risks as customers who are acquired based on their biases may be more likely to default in future. However, the analysis reveals that card issuers consider this trade-off and generally send shrouded offers only after consumers have improved their credit risk profile.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using granular data on the contract terms and design details of more than 1.3 million credit card offers, we document how card issuers shroud unappealing, back-loaded features of an offer (e.g., high default APRs, late or over-limit fees) via the position of the information, font size, or complexity of the language used. More heavily shrouded offers that rely on back-loaded fees are also more likely to be offered to less-educated consumers. In addition, we document a novel interaction between behavioral screening and adverse selection: Using changes in state-level unemployment insurance (UI) as positive shocks to consumer creditworthiness, we show that issuers rely more on shrouded and back-loaded fees when UI increases, especially for less-educated consumers. Card issuers weigh short-term rent maximization against increased credit risk when targeting consumers' behavioral biases.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Innovation in the financial sector (fintech) could disrupt existing business structures, change how existing firms create and deliver products and services, or widen access to financial services. Yet fintech also poses significant challenges to privacy, regulation and law-enforcement. It could also worsen some forms of discrimination. A key question is whether the potential efficiency gains that fintech could bring will be shared equally or lead to a rise in inequality.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper first investigates whether the rise of fintech has pushed down the unit cost of financial intermediation. If financial innovation over the last years has improved efficiency in the financial sector, this should manifest itself in lower costs. In a second step, the paper asks whether the potential gains from fintech will have distributional consequences. Will fintech increase access to financial services for previously unbanked or under-banked individuals? Or will it increase inequality by favouring some groups more than others? The paper also investigates the role of machine learning and big data.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper shows that the unit cost of financial intermediation has fallen since the Great Financial Crisis, concluding that fintech has made the financial sector more efficient. It then develops a simple model of robo-advising, showing that fintech's net effect on welfare crucially depends on the type and size of fixed costs it entails. Even if there is an overall increase in participation, various income groups might be affected differently. Finally, the author analyses the impact of big data on discrimination. Based on a model that features a new technology to analyse non-traditional consumer data, the author concludes that big data and machine learning will probably reduce human biases against minorities, but at the same time erode the effectiveness of existing regulations.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The cost of financial intermediation has declined in recent years thanks to technology and increased competition in some parts of the finance industry. I document this fact and I analyze two features of new financial technologies that have stirred controversy: returns to scale and the use of big data and machine learning. I argue that the nature of fixed versus variable costs in robo-advising is likely to democratize access to financial services. Big data is likely to reduce the impact of negative prejudice in the credit market but it could reduce the effectiveness of existing policies aimed at protecting minorities.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Operational risks are related to losses that could result from inadequate or failed internal processes, improper business practices, systems failures or from external events. Representing a significant portion of total bank risks, operational risks are currently second only to credit risks as a source of losses. Measuring and understanding operational risks, including cyber risks, is critical for both banks and public authorities.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a unique cross-country data set from ORX, a consortium of financial institutions. The sample contains over 700,000 operational loss events from 2002 until end-2017 for a group of 74 large banks with headquarters worldwide. The granularity of the data set allows us to study the evolution of operational risks through time, compute an operational and cyber value-at-risk for financial intermediaries, document the time lag between occurrence, discovery and recognition of losses, and investigate the link between operational losses, macroeconomic conditions and regulatory characteristics.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>After a spike following the Great Financial Crisis, operational losses have fallen in recent years. The spike was largely due to losses arising from improper business practices in large banks that were incurred in the run-up to the crisis but recognised only later. Operational value-at-risk can vary substantially across banks - from 6% to 12% of total gross income - depending on the method used. It takes, on average, more than a year for operational losses to be discovered and recognised in the books. However, there is significant variation across regions and event types. For instance, improper business practices and internal fraud events take longer to be discovered. Operational losses are not independent of macroeconomic conditions and regulatory characteristics. In particular, the paper shows that credit booms and periods of excessively accommodative monetary policy are followed by larger operational losses. Better supervision, on the other hand, is associated with lower operational losses. Cyber losses are still a small portion of operational losses, but can account for a significant share of total operational value-at-risk.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper asks how the exchange rate affects corporate investment. Acting via a "financial channel", movements in the exchange rate influence domestic financial conditions by strengthening or weakening the balance sheets of domestic borrowers and foreign lenders. These effects arise from currency mismatches on balance sheets, or more generally through risk premia as global investors adjust their portfolios. Through this financial channel, a weakening of the exchange rate would be associated with a tightening of financial conditions, dampening economic activity. This contrasts with the traditional trade channel, where a fall in the exchange rate tends to have expansionary economic effects.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We first propose a simple theoretical model to analyse different mechanisms through which the exchange rate might impact credit supply and hence investment. We then assess empirically the financial channel of the exchange rate using firm-level data for a group of advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs). To identify the financial channel of the exchange rate on investment, we use the cross-sectional variation in firm leverage and FX debt.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the exchange rate affects corporate investment through a financial channel: a fall in the exchange rate dampens corporate investment, acting via firm leverage and FX debt. The effect is more pronounced in EMEs, reflecting their greater dependence on foreign funding and less developed financial systems. Moreover, we find that exchange rate depreciation induces debt-laden firms to increase their cash holdings. This also supports, from a different angle, the notion that the exchange rate also operates as a financial channel. Overall, these findings suggest that the large depreciation of EME currencies since 2011 amplified the recent slowdown of investment in these economies.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using firm-level data for 18 major global economies, we find that the exchange rate affects corporate investment through a financial channel: exchange rate depreciation dampens corporate investment through firm leverage and FX debt. These findings are consistent with the predictions of a stylised model of credit risk in which exchange rates can affect investment through FX debt or borrowing in local currency from foreign lenders. Empirically, the channel is more pronounced in emerging market economies (EMEs), reflecting their greater dependence on foreign funding and their less developed financial systems. Moreover, we find that exchange rate depreciation induces highly leveraged firms to increase their cash holdings, supporting from a different angle the notion of a financial channel of the exchange rate. Overall, these findings suggest that the large depreciation of EME currencies since 2011 was probably a significant amplifying factor in the recent investment slowdown in these economies.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper looks at how agents in different economies around the world are adopting financial technology ("fintech"). Fintech services are expanding in payments, credit, wealth management and insurance, in both advanced and emerging market and developing economies. Yet the scale of adoption differs widely. The paper seeks to explain why fintech innovations are more widely adopted in some economies and markets, but not in others.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper draws from the nascent literature on fintech in different economies. It presents novel indicators and insights from empirical research on the use of fintech in different areas of financial services. It aims to present the evidence on the drivers of fintech adoption in a widely accessible way.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>There is evidence that fintech adoption is higher where (i) there is unmet demand for financial services; (ii) macroeconomic conditions are supportive; (iii) regulation is accommodative; and (iv) demographic forces, such as a young population, are favourable, bolstering trust in new providers. An implication is that, where fintech helps to enhance financial inclusion, this is likely to be positive for economic growth and development. Fintech activity could also increase cross-border competition in financial services over time. Finally, while fintech innovations can sometimes overcome specific market failures (eg by reducing information asymmetries or transaction costs) fintech activities will remain subject to the risks traditionally present in finance, such as liquidity mismatches, speculative bubbles, interconnectedness and, potentially, systemic importance.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Fintech is being adopted across markets worldwide - but not evenly. Why not? This paper reviews the evidence. In some economies, especially in the developing world, adoption is being driven by an unmet demand for financial services. Fintech promises to deliver greater financial inclusion. In other economies, adoption can be related to the high cost of traditional finance, a supportive regulatory environment, and other macroeconomic factors. Finally, demographics play an important role, as younger cohorts are more likely to trust and adopt fintech services. Where fintech helps to make the financial system more inclusive and efficient, this could benefit economic growth. Yet the market failures traditionally present in finance remain relevant, and may manifest themselves in new guises.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper asks whether bad banks, more formally known as impaired asset segregation tools, and recapitalisation lead to a recovery in the lending of the originating banks and a reduction in their non-performing loans.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Bad banks have become a widely used way for supervisors and private investors to clean up the balance sheets of troubled banks. Yet the literature still lacks a comprehensive study on which specific design for a bad bank is best at promoting bank lending and reducing non-performing loans. This paper fills the gap by assembling and analysing a new data set on 38 impaired asset management schemes ("bad banks") that covers a total of 135 banks from 15 European banking systems over the 2000-16 period.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The main finding is that bad banks are effective in cleaning up balance sheets and promoting bank lending only if asset segregation is combined with recapitalisation of the bank's balance sheet. Used in isolation, neither tool will suffice to spur lending and reduce future NPLs. Looking at a wide range of episodes, we find that assets segregation is more effective when (i) asset purchases are funded privately; (ii) smaller shares of the originating bank's assets are segregated; and (iii) asset segregation occurs in countries with more efficient legal systems.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The paper investigates whether impaired asset segregation tools, otherwise known as bad banks, and recapitalisation lead to a recovery in the originating banks' lending and a reduction in non-performing loans (NPLs). Results are based on a novel data set covering 135 banks from 15 European banking systems over the period 2000-16. The main finding is that bad bank segregations are effective in cleaning up balance sheets and promoting bank lending only if they combine recapitalisation with asset segregation. Used in isolation, neither tool will suffice to spur lending and reduce future NPLs. Exploiting the heterogeneity in asset segregation events, we find that asset segregation is more effective when: (i) asset purchases are funded privately; (ii) smaller shares of the originating bank's assets are segregated; and (iii) asset segregation occurs in countries with more efficient legal systems.

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange (FX) spot market can be affected by liquidity dislocations in FX swaps. There are three reasons for this: first, the pricing of spot and FX swaps is linked; second, FX swaps have increased in importance as FX funding instruments, which has implications for FX liquidity; and third, there is a significant overlap between dealers providing liquidity in both market segments.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Previous studies of FX market liquidity have focused exclusively on the spot market. By contrast, this paper takes into account the enormous importance of FX swaps in global FX trading. In this context, we also analyse the joint behaviour of funding and market liquidity in FX. Our identification strategy relies on exogenous quarter-end funding liquidity shocks in FX swap markets to study their effects on spot market liquidity. We also add to the studies that examine the relationship between FX market liquidity and dealer competition. Finally, we contribute to the academic literature on covered interest parity (CIP) deviations by documenting supply side drivers of the dislocations related to the pull-back of trading desks belonging to global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>First, bid-ask spreads in spot and FX swaps are highly correlated. Second, deterioration in FX funding liquidity, as measured by forward discount or CIP deviations, is associated with a widening of bid-ask spreads in spot FX. Third, this link between FX funding and market liquidity conditions has strengthened significantly since mid-2014. Fourth, the partial shift of intermediation in FX swaps toward smaller dealers as the desks of G-SIBs periodically pull back is behind much of the liquidity dynamics described.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the joint evolution of foreign exchange (FX) spot and swap market liquidity. Trading in FX swaps exceeds that of spot, yet this market segment has been largely ignored in prior research on liquidity in FX markets. We find strong co-movement in spot and swap market liquidity conditions and a strong link between FX funding and market liquidity, as gleaned from the pricing of both instruments. This link has strengthened over time with changes in dealer behaviour. Some of the largest dealers periodically pull back from pricing FX swaps and wider spreads attract smaller dealers. At the same time, liquidity in FX swaps remains impaired, which leads to adverse illiquidity spillovers to the spot market. Our findings suggest that funding liquidity has become a more important driver of spot market liquidity than it used to be.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Many households lack the expertise they need to make complex financial decisions. As a result, they are more susceptible to being steered by banks towards certain financial products via advice, advertising or shrouding among other gambits. This study analyses the effects of so-called steering by banks on consumer welfare, focusing on the choice between plain vanilla fixed and adjustable rate mortgages. Using a structural model for Italy, we ask if banks' steering activity works differently on clients with differing degrees of financial sophistication.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In our model, each bank builds its optimal mortgage portfolio by both setting rates and steering customers. "Sophisticated" households know which mortgage type is best for them, while "naive" ones are susceptible to steering by their bank. Using data on Italian mortgages, we estimate the model and quantify the welfare implications of steering.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that banks' steering activity may generate distortions. Its welfare effects vary across households, depending on their sophistication. Yet measures to restrict banks' scope for steering their customers would not necessarily increase household welfare. This is because such steering activities, even if potentially distortive, do generally convey some useful information. However, a financial literacy campaign always has a beneficial effect on the welfare of naive households, which are proportionately more exposed to the risk of taking inappropriate financial decisions.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We build a model of the mortgage market where banks attain their optimal mortgage portfolio by setting rates and "steering" customers. "Sophisticated" households know which mortgage type is best for them, while "naïve" ones are susceptible to steering by their banks. Using data on the universe of Italian mortgages, we estimate the model and quantify the welfare implications of steering. The analysis shows that banks' steering activity could generate distortions, with welfare effects that vary between households depending on their degree of sophistication. However, the introduction of measures to restrict the scope for banks to steer their customers would not necessarily increase household welfare, because such activities, even if potentially distortive, may also contain useful information. By contrast, a financial literacy campaign always has a beneficial effect on the welfare of naïve households, which are proportionately more exposed to the risk of taking inappropriate financial decisions.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Financial technology (fintech) is taking on an ever more important role in lending decisions. This paper compares the predictive power of credit scoring models based on machine learning techniques, as used by fintech companies, with that of traditional loss and default models typically used by banks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Using proprietary transaction-level data from a leading Chinese fintech company for the period between May and September 2017, we test the ability of different models to predict losses and defaults both in normal times and when the economy is subject to a shock. In particular, we analyse the case of an exogenous change in shadow banking regulation in China that caused lending to decline and credit conditions to deteriorate.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the model based on machine learning and non-traditional data used by the fintech company is better able to predict losses and defaults than traditional models in the presence of a negative shock to the aggregate credit supply. One possible reason for this is that machine learning can better mine the non-linear relationship between variables in a period of stress. Finally, the comparative advantage of the model that uses the fintech credit scoring technique based on machine learning and big data tends to decline for borrowers with a longer credit history.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We propose a new way of monitoring the risk exposure of a central counterparty (CCP) towards its clearing members, ie "CCP exposure". We track and break down changes in CCP exposure into price- and position-related factors. We study how these factors interact under stressed market conditions, ie when CCP exposure is at a high <em>level</em> or undergoes a large and abrupt <em>increase</em>. In addition, we examine which of the members' accounts feature most prominently in shaping the total exposure in these circumstances: the house accounts, which tend to conduct leveraged trades and have little loss-absorbing capacity, or client accounts, where losses are more easily absorbed.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We contribute to a rapidly expanding literature on central clearing by proposing an approach to monitoring CCP exposure intra-daily. This approach is particularly useful in stressed markets, when trading is fast-paced and data come in rapidly. Our approach copes with such "big data" challenges and, in particular, sheds light on how the commonality of exposures across clearing members increases a CCP's overall exposure in stressed markets.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the drivers of a CCP's overall exposure in stressed markets are fundamentally different from those in normal times.</p>
<p>For the first set of findings, we consider <em>changes</em> in CCP exposure. When these changes are of a typical size, they reflect almost entirely changes in the trading positions of clearing members. However, extremely large <em>increases</em> in CCP exposure tend to stem either from a spike in the volatility of security returns or from higher commonality of the exposures due to similar trading strategies, ie "crowding".</p>
<p>Second, we consider the level of CCP exposure. Again, we find that - in contrast to normal times - high levels stem mostly from crowding. More specifically, at times of market stress, the bulk of CCP exposure is concentrated in a few clearing members and a small set of risk factors.</p>
<p>Third, we find that the share of house accounts in CCP exposure remains roughly the same in stressed as in normal times. However, a larger share of the total house-account exposure stems from just a few clearing members.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Time is valuable, particularly in stressed markets. As central counterparties (CCPs) have become systemically important, we need to understand the dynamics of their exposure towards clearing members at high frequencies. We track such exposure and decompose it, yielding the following insights. The composition of CCP exposure is fundamentally different in the tails. At extreme levels or during rapid increases, there is elevated crowding. This is the result of clearing members all concentrating their positions on a single security or a particular portfolio, which is desirable if motivated by hedging but worrying if due to speculation.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We analyse whether the global financial cycle affects credit supply in Brazil, its related real effects, and whether local unconventional policies can attenuate such spillovers. After the announcement of the tapering of US quantitative easing by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in May 2013, domestic banks with a greater reliance on foreign debt reduced the supply of credit to firms in local currency, which in turn lowered employment. However, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) attenuated these negative effects by announcing a large intervention programme in the FX derivatives market, consisting in providing insurance against FX risks - <em>hedger of last resort</em>.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>There is a large literature exploring the lending channel in emerging market economies and its dependence on global financial conditions. However, that literature does not evaluate how local unconventional policies, such as FX interventions, can attenuate the effects of the global financial cycle on local credit markets and on the overall economy. A growing literature on FX interventions has focused on sterilised FX interventions. The evidence on the effectiveness of these tools is a source of controversy, though. In this paper, we use micro-data from Brazil and focus on a different form of intervention using FX derivatives and find a potent channel that directly affects domestic banks, with related effects on firms' credit intake and labour demand.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>For identification, we exploit global financial cycle shocks, the differential reliance of domestic banks on foreign debt, and central bank interventions in FX derivatives using three matched administrative registers: the register of foreign credit flows to banks, the credit register, and a matched employer-employee database. We find that banks with larger foreign debt liabilities contracted credit supply following the "taper tantrum", which tightened financial conditions for firms more dependent on these banks for funding, with related implications for firms' labour demand. After these events, the BCB intervention programme halved these effects. In addition to exploring these two subsequent shocks in a difference-in-difference strategy, we analyse a panel over 2008-15 and find a broader channel: banks with larger foreign debt responded to US dollar appreciation, increased FX volatility, and tighter US monetary policy by decreasing credit supply. FX interventions mitigated these effects of the global financial cycle on credit, confirming that policies promoting the supply of hedging instruments are effective in decreasing local economy exposure to global conditions.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We show that local central bank policies attenuate global ﬁnancial cycle (GFC)'s spillovers. For identiﬁcation, we exploit GFC shocks and Brazilian interventions in FX derivatives using three matched administrative registers: credit, foreign credit ﬂows to banks, and employer-employee. After U.S. Federal Reserve Taper Tantrum (followed by strong Emerging Markets FX depreciation and volatility increase), Brazilian banks with larger ex-ante reliance on foreign debt strongly cut credit supply, thereby reducing ﬁrm-level employment. However, a large FX intervention program supplying derivatives against FX risks-hedger of last resort-halves the negative effects. Finally, a 2008-2015 panel exploiting GFC shocks and local related policies conﬁrm these results.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Shareholders and unsecured creditors should bear the losses if a firm fails. During past crises, this simple principle did not hold for banks considered "too big to fail". Bail-in regulation seeks to address this problem by earmarking some debt instruments as "bail-inable". If bail-in regulation functions well, the investors in these instruments should expect to bear losses in the course of resolution. Accordingly, they should monitor banks and exert discipline on their risk-taking. This paper studies whether this is indeed the case.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We explore the global market for bail-inable bank debt, focussing on the largest market segment: senior unsecured bonds. We identify the bail-in risk premium by carefully matching these bonds with comparable senior bonds that are not subject to bail-in risk. We identify the main drivers of the bail-in risk premium for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and other major banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Investors exert market discipline on G-SIBs by demanding a bail-in risk premium. We find that this premium averages 20 basis points (2016-18), with riskier banks having to pay even more. Yet the bail-in premium varies pro-cyclically: when market-wide credit risk declines, the premium falls, and it does so most strongly for the riskier issuers. Banks take advantage of this pattern and time their bail-in bond issuance accordingly. The flipside of compressed premia during good times is that, during periods of market stress, riskier issuers could be exposed to material increases in the cost of bail-in debt. This reinforces the value of a conservatively calibrated bail-in regime alongside stringent supervision to ensure that banks build up their resilience during good times.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Bail-in regulation is a centrepiece of the post-crisis overhaul of bank resolution. It requires major banks to maintain a sufficient amount of "bail-in debt" that can absorb losses during resolution. If resolution regimes are credible, investors in bail-in debt should have a strong incentive to monitor banks and price bail-in risk. We study the pricing of senior bail-in bonds to evaluate whether this is the case. We identify the bail-in risk premium by matching these bonds with comparable senior bonds that are issued by the same banking group but are not subject to bail-in risk. The premium is higher for riskier issuers, consistent with the notion that bond investors exert market discipline on banks. Yet the premium varies pro-cyclically: a decline in marketwide credit risk lowers the bail-in risk premium for all banks, with the compression much stronger for riskier issuers. Banks, in turn, time their bail-in bond issuance to take advantage of periods of low premia.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Thanks to their superior liquidity, benchmark bonds are the primary instruments used by market participants to take positions and adjust prices in response to new information. Those prices then serve as a reference for the rest of the bond market, thus helping to improve the market's efficiency. Benchmarks seem to arise spontaneously in deep and liquid markets. But can government policy lend a hand in creating them where markets are too small? It turns out that some governments have tried. Authorities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have designated specific bonds as benchmarks and fostered their liquidity, with the aim of improving the functioning of their bond markets.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We start by identifying exactly which bonds were designated as benchmarks. We then compare the liquidity of these bonds against that of others with similar maturities. We consider superior liquidity to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for true benchmark status. To assess liquidity with sparse data, we propose a ranking approach that combines three simple measures. We interpret as success any time that the designated bonds are the most liquid ones in their market segment. We also identify factors that influence how successful authorities have been.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that efforts to establish benchmark bonds in three emerging markets in Asia have been generally successful. Designated benchmark bonds are the most liquid bonds in their market segments in around 60% of months in our sample. In Malaysia, the success rate is 78%. Factors that contribute to this success include choosing as benchmark bonds those are (a) are already liquid; (b) have already served as de jure benchmarks at longer maturities in the past; and (c) will be issued during the month.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Benchmark bonds help to improve market efficiency. They seem to arise spontaneously in deep and liquid markets. Can governments help to create them where markets are too small? This paper examines three emerging markets in Asia where authorities have tried: they have designated specific bonds as benchmarks and fostered their liquidity. We identify exactly which bonds were the designated benchmarks. We then propose rank-order measures of liquidity and determine the extent to which these de jure benchmarks end up as de facto benchmarks in the sense of being the most liquid bonds in their maturity segments. We find that this occurs in close to 60% of months in our sample, covering a range of maturities for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. We identify three factors that make success more likely: (a) choosing already liquid bonds; (b) choosing bonds that have previously served as de jure benchmarks; and (c) choosing bonds that will be issued during the month.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The essay focuses on the threefold challenge central banks have been facing post-crisis - economic, intellectual and institutional. It pays special attention to central bank independence.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The essay examines these issues from a historical perspective. It draws parallels with the first globalisation era that ended in the 1930s with the Great Depression. Many observers regard that historical phase as the heyday of central bank independence. What are the lessons for today?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The essay argues that central bank independence is closely tied to globalisation. Both spring from the same fountainhead - an intellectual and political environment conducive to an open system in which countries adhere to the same principles and governments remain at arm's length from a market economy. A key way to safeguard independence is to narrow the growing gap between what central banks are expected to deliver and what they can actually deliver. Recently proposed schemes that involve controlled deficit monetisation can be harmful and undermine independence.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since the Great Financial Crisis, central banks have been facing a triple challenge: economic, intellectual and institutional. The institutional challenge is that central bank independence - a valuable institution - has come in for greater criticism. This essay takes a historical perspective and draws parallels with the previous waxing and waning of central bank independence. It suggests that this institution is closely tied to globalisation, as both spring from the same fountainhead: an intellectual and political environment that supports an open system in which countries adhere to the same principles and governments remain at arm′s length from the functioning of a market economy. This suggests that the fortunes of independence are also tied to those of globalisation. The essay then proceeds to explore ways that can help safeguard independence. A key one is to narrow the growing expectations gap between what central banks are expected to deliver and what they can actually deliver. In that context, it also considers and dismisses the usefulness of recently proposed schemes that involve controlled deficit monetisation.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Since 1945, the US dollar has dominated the international monetary and financial system. The dollar plays a particularly outsized role in official foreign exchange (FX) reserves. Scholars find it puzzling that its share has persisted at about two thirds of the total. After all, the US share of both world GDP and global trade has declined post-war. However, when researchers seek to understand the dollar's predominance in FX reserves, they quickly encounter severe data limitations that greatly impede empirical analysis.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We attempt to remove this impediment. To do so, we compile a data set from annual reports, financial statements and other relevant sources for 58 central banks across the world in 1999-2017. This data set makes a big contribution. The IMF's Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) data generally disclose only aggregates for the entire world, advanced economies and emerging market economies, not data on individual economies. Previous efforts to collect publicly available country data, including our own, came up with a mere two dozen cases. </p>
<p>Conceptually, we add to recent work on the dollar's role that emphasises the global uses of the dollar rather than the US economy. We innovate in assessing the influence of the dollar's anchor role for not only pegged currencies but also floating ones. We do so in a multivariate setting that includes the much-discussed influence of the dollar as an invoicing currency for exports.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Using this data set, we find that the greater the co-movement of the domestic currency with the dollar (euro), the higher its dollar (euro) share of FX reserves. This finding holds in both the cross section and the panel. This makes sense. If a currency varies less against the dollar than against other key currencies, then an FX reserve portfolio with a large dollar share poses less risk when returns are measured in domestic currency. We also find in smaller samples that the higher the dollar-denominated (euro-denominated) share of exports, the higher the dollar (euro) share in FX reserves. The effect of currency anchoring appears to be on a par with that of the unit of account in trade as determinants of reserve composition.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper analyses the factors that govern the choice of the currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves. First, we introduce a new panel dataset on the key currencies in foreign exchange reserves of about 60 economies in the 1999-2017 period. Second, we show that the currency composition of reserves relates strongly to the co-movement of the domestic currency with key currencies and the currency invoicing of trade. These factors represent attributes of the dollar or the euro rather than of the United States or the euro area. They exert about equal effects on the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves. We demonstrate that these findings are robust to a host of other possible factors.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The Great Financial Crisis led to a sharp decline in cross-border banking integration, putting an end to the steady increase in such integration over previous decades. Policymakers and academics have sought to better understand the effects of globally integrated banks on financial stability and the real economy. Several papers provide valuable evidence on the costs and benefits of lending by foreign banks. However, an analysis of how banks' global integration affects financial stability is largely absent from this literature.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper aims at empirically assessing the effect of banks' global integration on loan supply during banking crises in a cross-country setting. We provide the first evidence for the beneficial effects of banking integration <em>across </em>countries - their geographic diversification - on local loan supply. Moreover, we complement previous findings on the role of banks' nationality by investigating the interaction of banks' nationality with their geographic diversification. Detailed loan-level data on syndicated loans allow us to identify loan supply effects and to trace out the real effects on borrowing firms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We use detailed loan-level data on worldwide syndicated lending to investigate how geographic diversification affects banks' loan supply during banking crises in their host countries. To identify globally integrated banks, we construct a Herfindahl Index of the geographic diversification of banks' international loan portfolios. We find that diversified banks stabilise loan supply and smooth local shocks in borrower countries: they supply more credit during crises than do banks holding a more concentrated portfolio. Higher loan supply leads to higher investment and employment growth for firms borrowing from diversified banks. We establish that better access to new funds during times of distress helps banks with diversified portfolios to keep lending.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We classify a large sample of banks according to the geographic diversification of their international syndicated loan portfolio. Our results show that diversified banks maintain higher loan supply during banking crises in borrower countries. The positive loan supply effects lead to higher investment and employment growth for firms. Diversified banks have a stabilizing effect, thanks to their ability to raise additional funding during times of distress, which also shields connected markets from spillovers. Further distinguishing banks by nationality reveals a pecking order: diversified domestic banks are the most stable source of funding, while foreign banks with little diversification are the most fickle. Our findings suggest that the decline in financial integration since the recent crisis increases countries' vulnerability to local shocks.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the costs associated with clearing fragmentation as central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives contracts becomes more common. Fragmentation arises when multiple central counterparties (CCPs) clear the same or similar derivatives contracts. We focus on the "CCP basis", which refers to the price distortions that arise between such contracts.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Using proprietary data, we document and analyse an economically significant CCP basis for dollar swap contracts cleared at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the London Clearing House (LCH). We contribute to the ongoing policy debate about the fragmented clearing landscape by providing both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence for the driving factors behind the CCP basis.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the average CCP basis for dollar swap contracts was around 2 basis points during our sample period. This is economically significant as it translates into a <em>daily</em> opportunity cost of around $80 million for end users.</p>
<p>The CCP basis allows dealers to recoup increased collateral costs when clearing is fragmented. In those cases, dealers, who provide liquidity globally, cannot net their offsetting trades across CCPs. This increases their collateral costs. They pass these costs on to end users through the CCP basis. That is, dealers quote a higher price at a CCP where buyers prevail, and a lower price when sellers prevail.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that the CCP basis increases in the amount of dealers' posted collateral pledged with the CCP (ie the initial margin), dealers' credit spread and debt overhang costs, and the order-flow imbalance in one CCP. The basis decreases in the volume share of sophisticated traders with access to both CCPs who can therefore clear where prices are more advantageous.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Fragmenting clearing across multiple central counterparties (CCPs) is costly. This is because dealers providing liquidity globally, cannot net trades cleared in different CCPs and this increases their collateral costs. These costs are then passed on to their clients through price distortions which take the form of a price differential (basis) when the same products are cleared in different CCPs. Using proprietary data, we document an economically significant CCP basis for U.S. dollar swap contracts cleared both at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the LCH in London and provide evidence consistent with a collateral cost explanation of this basis.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Recent years have seen an increasing use of macroprudential policy to mitigate systemic risk. In addition to the effects on financial stability, theoretical models suggest various channels through which macroprudential policy could have broader macroeconomic effects on economic activity, consumption and investment. But empirical evidence on such macroeconomic effects remains sparse, in particular in a framework that would incorporate both monetary and macroprudential policy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We provide empirical evidence about the broader macroeconomic effects of macroprudential policy and the underlying transmission mechanism, as well as about the response of macroprudential policy to credit shocks. We also compare these with monetary policy. As the empirical methodology, the paper uses structural panel vector autoregressions and a dataset covering 32 advanced and emerging economies.</span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We find that macroprudential policy shocks have effects on real GDP, the price level and credit that are very similar to those of monetary policy shocks, but the detailed transmission of the two policies is different. Whereas macroprudential policy shocks mostly affect residential investment and household credit, monetary policy shocks have more widespread effects on the economy. We also find that positive credit shocks are generally met with tighter macroprudential policy, and macroprudential and monetary policy respond to credit shocks in a complementary way.</span></p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Since the 1990s, central banks have made policy announcements both more frequently and with more ambitious aims. Now regarded as a policy tool in its own right, central bank communications are closely watched by financial markets. In this paper, we construct a novel data set comprising the English versions of central bankers' speeches from 23 countries over the 2002-17 period, as sourced from the speech archive of the Bank for International Settlements. The sentiment of each speech is analysed using dictionary-based methods. We then assess how central banks affect each other's communication across borders, as well as critical macroeconomic and policy variables.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>That central bank communication aﬀects domestic interest rates and macroeconomic variables is already well known. Moreover, central bank communication has been shown to be particularly eﬀective during periods of unconventional policy.</p>
<p>This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive data set of sentiment scores for international central bank communication and makes the ﬁrst attempt to study international central bank communication spillovers across a large set of central banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Shocks from central bank communications can affect sentiment across borders, as well as policy rates and macroeconomic variables. In this, the Federal Reserve plays a uniquely influential role. We find that the extent to which central banks affect each other's communication across borders cannot be fully explained by trade or financial flows but it does appear that these effects weaken with geographic distance, even after controlling for reduced trade and financial flows. In addition, a shared language or colonial ties also tend to amplify the cross-border effects of central bank communications.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We construct a novel text dataset to measure the sentiment component of communications for 23 central banks over the 2002-2017 period. Our analysis yields three results. First, comovement in sentiment across central banks is not reducible to trade or financial flow exposures. Second, sentiment shocks generate cross-country spillovers in sentiment, policy rates, and macroeconomic variables; and the Fed appears to be a uniquely influential generator of such spillovers, even among prominent central banks. And third, geographic distance is a robust and economically significant determinant of comovement in central bank sentiment, while shared language and colonial ties have weaker predictive power.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Regulators have introduced stress tests for the largest banks with the aim of ensuring that they hold enough capital to withstand another crisis. Stress tests have effectively reduced systemic risk and improved risk management and capital planning at individual institutions. However, policymakers and academics worry about the potential negative effects on credit and the real economy. This paper investigates how regulatory stress tests may have affected entrepreneurship in the United States.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Contributing to the literature that highlights some negative consequences of stress tests on credit supply to small businesses, this paper presents new evidence on the real effects of financial regulation. Regulatory stress tests for the largest banks might have an unintended side effect by curtailing credit to young businesses, which are especially dependent on external financing. The contraction in lending has the potential to stymie entrepreneurship and innovation. This novel channel, through which stress tests dampen economic dynamism, could help to explain the persistent decline in entrepreneurship since the crisis.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Stress-tested banks have sharply reduced home equity loans to small businesses, an important source of financing for entrepreneurs. The resulting contraction in loan supply has affected the real economy. By exploiting geographical variation in county exposure to stress-tested banks, the paper shows that counties with a higher exposure have experienced a relative decline in employment at young firms during the recovery, especially in industries that rely more on home equity financing.</p>
<p>Additional findings also suggest that counties with a higher exposure to stress-tested banks have seen a decline in patent applications by young firms, as well as a fall in labour productivity. The latter finding reflects the disproportionate contribution of young firms to innovation and growth. While the results do not imply that stress tests have reduced overall welfare, they highlight a possible trade-off between financial stability and economic dynamism.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Post-crisis stress tests have helped to enhance financial stability and to reduce banks' risk-taking. In order to quantify their overall impact, regulators have turned to evaluating the effects of stress tests on financing and the real economy. Using the U.S. as a laboratory, this paper shows that stress tests have had potentially unintended side effects on entrepreneurship and innovation at young firms. Banks subject to stress tests have strongly cut small business loans secured by home equity, an important source of financing for entrepreneurs. Lower credit supply has led to a relative decline in entrepreneurship during the recovery in counties with higher exposure to stress tested banks. The decline has been steeper in sectors with a higher share of young firms using home equity financing, i.e. where the reduction in credit hit hardest. Counties with higher exposure have also seen a decline in patent applications by young firms. I provide suggestive evidence that the decline in credit has negatively affected labor productivity, reflecting young firms' disproportionate contribution to growth. My results do not imply that stress tests reduce welfare, but highlight a possible trade-off between financial stability and economic dynamism. The effects of stress tests on entrepreneurship should be taken into account when evaluating their effectiveness.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Banks' shadow, or money creation by banks beyond traditional loans, plays an important role in China's money-creation process. This poses a number of challenges to monetary policy operations and financial risk management. This paper analyses the money-creation mechanisms of China's shadow banking sector in detail, provides accurate measurements, investigates its effects on financial risk and surveys recent regulations.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The analysis highlights the critical role of banks' shadow in creating credit money while hiding the credit risk incurred by banks. The challenges posed to monetary policy regulation and financial risk management are also assessed. First, the paper clarifies the definition of shadow banking in China, decomposing it into banks' shadow and traditional shadow banking. Second, this paper quantifies the scale of shadow banking in China using the deduction approach, with the aim of avoiding miscalculation issues such as double-counting and overestimation. Third, the relationship between shadow banking credit and financial risk is investigated at both the macro and micro levels. Finally, the monetary policy challenges posed by Chinese shadow banking is discussed and the recent trend to tighten regulation surveyed.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>At the macro level, Chinese shadow banking funds are used mainly for local government funding vehicles, enterprises with excess capacity, and real estate developers. Banks' shadow is closely related to the money creation indicator M2, while traditional shadow banking is less relevant, reducing the accuracy of M2 as a policy measure. At the micro level, this paper uses the balance sheet information of 311 banks (including listed and non-listed banks) over the past decade. It finds that, although banks' shadow drives up banks' credit risk, banks have not adequately assessed that risk or taken the appropriate countermeasures. In the future, the key to regulating China's shadow banking system will be to strengthen the regulatory mechanism centred on banks.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Banks' shadow, or money creation by banks beyond traditional loans, plays an important role in China's money-creation process, posing a number of challenges to monetary policy operations and financial risk management. This paper analyzes the money-creation mechanisms of China's shadow banking sector in detail, provides accurate measurements, investigates its effects on financial risk, and surveys recent regulation. To strengthen supervision, China's regulators should closely track the evolution of various shadow banking channels, both on- and off-balance sheet. Specific macroprudential regulation tools, such as asset reserves and risk reserves, should be applied separately to banks' shadow and traditional shadow banking.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies whether central bank liquidity provisions spur or inhibit interbank market liquidity exchanges, or do not affect them at all. In other words, it studies whether the relationship between central bank and interbank liquidity is complementary or substitutive, and whether the relationship changes in the event of interbank market impairments and massive central bank liquidity injections during global and sovereign crises.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The analysis of the paper is relevant because having an adequate amount of liquidity in the system and adequate liquidity circulation throughout the banking system may both be crucial for the correct functioning of the economy. The paper reports findings based on 17 years of data on all the relationships of each bank operating in Italy vis-à-vis the ECB and every single (domestic and foreign) interbank counterparty.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The empirical results show that, both in normal times and in crises, the relationship between the central bank and interbank liquidity is complementary. Banks receiving central bank liquidity redistribute more to other banks. When central bank liquidity increases exponentially during a crisis, some healthy banks specialise in interbank lending. The complementarity helps to offset euro area fragmentation via domestic interbank relationships and to adjust the collateral and maturity profiles of banks' liquidity.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies the mutual interplay between central bank (CB) liquidity provisions and interbank market (IM) liquidity exchanges, exploring whether the relationship changes in the event of IM impairments and massive CB liquidity injections during global and sovereign crises. The analysis uses a data set containing 17 years of monthly bank-by-bank and counterparty-by-counterparty data collated from 1998 to 2015 in Italy. The results show the existence of complementarity. Banks receiving CB liquidity redistribute more to other banks. When CB liquidity increases exponentially during crises, some healthy banks specialise in interbank lending. The complementarity helps to offset euro area fragmentation via domestic interbank relationships and to adjust the collateral and maturity profiles of banks' liquidity.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The uncertainties associated with possible changes in government leadership or policy can affect the behaviour of firms through various channels, such as industry regulation, monetary and trade policy, and taxation. Indeed, a growing literature shows that non-financial firms cut back investment expenditure when they face policy uncertainty around elections. However, it is an open question how policy uncertainty would affect banks' lending behaviour. And it is an important one because financial institutions, which operate in a heavily regulated industry, are likely to face more uncertainty than non-financial firms do when the political landscape changes, and their response to such changes may have a ripple effect on the economy because of their role as intermediaries. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">It is empirically challenging to establish a causal relationship between policy uncertainty and banks' mortgage lending decisions. First, any observable change in bank lending is an equilibrium outcome reflecting both the credit supply from banks and demand from borrowers. Second, a relationship between uncertainty and banks' investment decisions can be endogenous, as an economic downturn can itself generate a great deal of political uncertainty. Thus, establishing a causal relationship requires an exogenous measure of political uncertainty. This paper attempts to address these challenges in two ways. First, we take advantage of high-frequency, geographically granular US loan-level data - confidential Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data - to control for changing local demand for loans. Second, we employ a plausibly exogenous measure of policy uncertainty: the timing of US gubernatorial elections. </span></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We show that banks reduce the supply of mortgage credit in the quarters before their headquarter states hold gubernatorial elections. In our baseline regressions, we focus on the types of loan that we consider relatively more costly to reverse - jumbo loans held on bank balance sheets - as models of investment under uncertainty suggest that irreversibility increases the information value of waiting to invest, causing investment to vary negatively with fluctuations in policy uncertainty over time. However, the results hold for a broader universe of loans, although the magnitude is weaker than for jumbo loans held on bank balance sheets. Banks reduce lending both in their headquarter states and other states, suggesting that the pattern in the data is unlikely to be driven by changing demand in banks' headquarter states. We document heterogeneity across banks in their sensitivity to electoral uncertainty. First, state-chartered banks are more sensitive to changes in their state's political leadership following elections, implying that potential changes to state bank regulations create an additional layer of uncertainty for state banks as compared with national banks. Second, riskier banks cut mortgage credit a little more than less risky banks. The mortgage lending cycle around elections is more pronounced for less certain elections, as measured by closely contested election races and term-limited elections, where the incumbent governor cannot run for a re-election due to a term limit.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We show that banks reduce the supply of jumbo mortgage loans when policy uncertainty increases, as measured by the timing of US gubernatorial elections in banks' headquarter states. We use high-frequency, geographically granular loan-level data to address an identification problem arising from the changing demand for loans: (1) The data allow for a difference-in-difference specification and for state/time (quarter) fixed effects; (2) we observe banks reduce lending not just in their home states but also outside their home states when their home states hold elections; (3) we observe important cross-sectional differences in the way banks with different characteristics respond to policy uncertainty. Overall, the findings suggest that policy uncertainty has a real effect on residential housing markets through banks' credit supply decisions and that it can spill over across states through lending by banks serving multiple states.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Since the mid-1980s, the nature of recessions has changed from inflation-induced to financial cycle-induced recessions. Against this backdrop, this paper formally assesses the forecasting performance of financial cycles to predict recessions in a panel of countries. We compare the signalling power of financial cycle measures with that of the term spread, a widely used benchmark in the literature.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>While a large body of literature finds that financial cycles matter for the real economy, research exploring how they affect the likelihood of a future recession is scant. We fill this gap.</p>
<p>Moreover, to ensure generality, we evaluate the forecasting performance of financial cycle measures not only for the United States but also for a panel of advanced and emerging market economies. This is in contrast to much of the literature, which focuses solely on the United States.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that financial cycle measures have significant forecasting power both in and out of sample. They generally perform better than the term spread across different economies and different forecasting horizons. And these results are robust to different recession specifications.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Financial cycles can be important drivers of real activity, but there is scant evidence about how well they signal recession risks. We run a horse race between the term spread - the most widely used indicator in the literature - and a range of financial cycle measures. Unlike most papers, ours assesses forecasting performance not just for the United States but also for a panel of advanced and emerging market economies. We find that financial cycle measures have significant forecasting power both in and out of sample, even for a three-year horizon. Moreover, they outperform the term spread in nearly all specifications. These results are robust to different recession specifications.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>What if monetary policy impart a long-run impact on output and inflation-adjusted interest rates -"non-neutrality"? What are the implications for the conduct of policy?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a stylised model with long-run monetary policy non-neutrality based on two key features. First, households have finite planning horizons and banks extend loans as well as create inside money, which is essential for economic activity. In this setting, there is no single 'natural rate of interest' to which the economy gravitates. Second, bank competition in the presence of externalities leads to endogenous boom-bust cycles. The model yields new insights about the role of monetary policy in macroeconomic stabilisation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The economy's evolution over long horizons depends critically on the behaviour of the central bank. Short term-focused policy rules lead to more frequent boom-bust cycles as well as lower average real interest rates and output. In contrast to popular explanations, the secular decline in real interest rates need not reflect only saving-investment drivers - the monetary regime itself may play a contributing role.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A long tradition of macroeconomic analysis accords monetary policy only a transient role in driving real outcomes. At the same time, a large body of evidence highlights the long-lasting impact of boom-bust cycles. We present a model where monetary policy, through its impact on and reaction to the financial cycle, influences long-term economic trajectories. The core setup is an overlapping generations model featuring bank financing – the creation of bank loans and inside money – which is critical for production and consumption. Monetary policy attains the first-best allocation by sustaining an efficient flow of financing. We then introduce coordination-failure frictions among lenders, which give rise to an endogenous boom-bust cycle in bank financing and an intertemporal policy tradeoff. A forward-looking policymaker optimally leans against excessive risk-taking during the boom, trading off short-term activity with longer-term stability. An inordinate focus on short-term outcomes can lead to `monetary policy hysteresis', where low interest rates increase the vulnerability to financial busts over successive cycles. As a result, low rates can beget lower rates.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Financial stability is key in monetary policy deliberation. There is ample evidence that low interest rate <em>levels</em> create financial imbalances. But how policy <em>reacts </em>to macro-financial developments could also matter. This is the subject of this paper.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We measure how responsive US monetary policy appears to be to imbalances in equity, housing and credit markets. We examine if this policy sensitivity predicts later evolution of financial imbalances. The exercise is important because policy implications are far-reaching.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>When policy reacts more to financial overheating, imbalances tend to moderate later. This is so despite holding interest rate levels fixed. A more countercyclical reaction also predicts more stable financial markets. Systematic policy responses thus matter for safeguarding financial stability.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper examines whether monetary policy reaction function matters for financial stability. We measure how responsive the Federal Reserve's policy appears to be to imbalances in the equity, housing and credit markets. We find that changes in these policy sensitivities predict the later development of financial imbalances. When monetary policy appears to respond more countercyclically to market overheating, imbalances tend to decline over time. This effect is distinct from that of current and anticipated interest rate levels - the risk-taking channel. The evidence highlights the importance of a "policy reaction function" channel of monetary policy in shaping the financial cycle.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How does financial market fragmentation relate to financial stability? Does more fragmentation always imply less financial stability? Alternatively, might there be a trade-off between the two, with more fragmentation enhancing financial stability in some cases? Taking a cross-jurisdictional perspective, this paper reviews the literature with the aim of shedding light on the issue and making suggestions for further analysis.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper sets out various definitions of fragmentation, distinguishing price-based measures - differences in the prices of equivalent assets across countries - and quantity-based measures - deviations from benchmarks in international investment positions. It considers four types of cause: natural barriers; market forces; policy actions and interventions other than financial regulatory actions; and, finally, regulations and their enforcement. Although difficult, empirical methods used in other contexts can help isolate the specific cause and its effects.</p>
<p>The costs and benefits of fragmentation are reviewed from a financial stability perspective, using examples from securities markets, international banking and asset prices. Policy actions at the global level typically mean fewer regulatory and institutional differences between countries. Hence, markets globally tend to converge towards uniformity and less fragmentation. Since financial regulation, even when aimed at greater financial stability, inherently introduces frictions and barriers, it can nevertheless lead to some fragmentation. Thus trade-offs could arise between financial stability and fragmentation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The review suggests that reducing fragmentation and enhancing financial stability are, in general, highly likely to be complementary. Yet fragmentation is not necessarily harmful for financial stability. In specific cases, some degree of fragmentation can actually serve to enhance financial stability. To assess possible trade-offs requires the various causes of fragmentation to be identified, together with a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. Cooperation - global in nature, and involving both public and private actions - can help.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The many regulatory reforms following the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 have most often been designed and adopted through an international cooperative process. As such, actions have tended to harmonise national approaches and diminish inconsistencies. Nevertheless, some market participants and policymakers have recently raised concerns over an unwanted and unnecessary degree of fragmentation in financial markets globally, with possibly adverse effects for financial stability. This paper reviews the degree of fragmentation in various markets and classifies its possible causes. It then reviews whether fragmentation is necessarily detrimental to financial stability, suggesting that, as is more likely, various trade-offs exist. To identify and assess the scope for Pareto improvements, it concludes by outlining areas for further analysis.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The close co-movement between long-term interest rates internationally has been well documented. However, there is only limited understanding about how changes in the individual components of long-term rates - expectations of real rates and inflation, and the term premia - are transmitted internationally. The relative strength of the spillovers from the different components could differ. While the distinction is not clear cut, unconventional monetary policy in the form of quantitative easing is typically considered to work on the yield curve mainly through term premia, and conventional interest rate policy and forward guidance mainly through expectations. The spillovers of unconventional and conventional policies could, in turn, differ in magnitude, with different effects on monetary conditions in the "receiving" economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We estimate spillovers from real rate and inflation expectations and term premia in the United States on long-term interest rates abroad, using monthly panel data for a large number of advanced and emerging economies (EMEs). We also study how macro-financial vulnerabilities in emerging economies affect these spillovers. We consider macro-financial indicators comprising the current account balance, the headline fiscal balance, the stock of total external debt, as well as outstanding portfolio debt and equity liabilities.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We find that interest rate spillovers tend to be large, and that spillovers from all four components of long-term rates in the United States are significant. However, we also find that there are differences in how movements in the yield curve components affect long-term rates in the different economies. In particular, changes in US term premia have a stronger impact on yields in advanced economies than in EMEs. In EMEs, we find that spillovers to domestic long-term rates from the US expectations components are more sizeable than those from the US term premia. We also find that spillovers from US yields tend to be larger when a receiving EME displays greater macro-financial vulnerabilities. In particular, interest rate spillovers driven by shifts in the US inflation risk premium are sensitive to EME vulnerabilities.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We analyse how movements in the components of sovereign bond yields in the United States affect long-term rates in 10 advanced and 21 emerging economies. The paper documents significant global spillovers from both the expectations and term premia components of long-term rates in the United States. We find that spillovers to domestic long-term rates in emerging economies from the US expectations components tend to be more sizeable than those from the US term premia. Finally, spillovers from US term premia are larger when an emerging economy displays greater macro-financial vulnerabilities.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Following the 2008-09 crisis, a number of central banks cut monetary policy rates to levels close to the effective lower bound. We propose a regime-switching approach to deal with the lower bound in dynamic term structure modelling.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our model allows the drivers (state variables) of yields to evolve according to separate laws of motion in normal times and at the lower bound. The model is able to capture important differences in the way the economy operates when it is at the lower bound, compared with normal times, as well as the resulting implications for bond pricing. Another feature of the model is that the probability of switching from one regime to the other depends on the level of the short-term interest rate. These features of the model allow for a very gradual normalisation of monetary policy following a lower bound episode.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We apply our model to US data and show that it does well in fitting key properties of yields at the lower bound. Moreover, after interest rates "lift off", the model is able to capture the slow pace of monetary policy normalisation that is evident from the recent US experience. This is because the possibility of returning to the lower bound regime continues to influence the early phases of normalisation, pulling expected future interest rates downwards. Finally, a reliable yield-forecasting performance results from the model's ability to account for different state dynamics in and out of the lower bound period, coupled with its ability to allow for a high probability of switching back to the lower bound regime after having exited it.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We propose a regime-switching approach to deal with the lower bound on nominal interest rates in dynamic term structure modelling. In the "lower bound regime", the short term rate is expected to remain constant at levels close to the effective lower bound; in the "normal regime", the short rate interacts with other economic variables in a standard way. State-dependent regime switching probabilities ensure that the likelihood of being in the lower bound regime increases as short rates fall closer to zero. A key advantage of this approach is to capture the gradualism of the monetary policy normalization process following a lower bound episode. The possibility to return to the lower bound regime continues exerting an influence in the early phases of normalization, pulling expected future rates downwards. We apply our model to U.S. data and show that it captures key properties of yields at the lower bound. In spite of its heavier parameterization, the regime-switching model displays a competitive out-of-sample forecasting performance. It can also be used to gauge the risk of a return to the lower bound regime in the future. As of mid-2018, it provides a more benign assessment than alternative measures.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper presents a new benchmark against which current economic growth rates of different economies can be assessed at any point in time. The measure can be used, for instance, to assess whether there is any risk of overheating or of build-up of excessive slack.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper computes steady-state economic growth - defined as the rate of growth that the economy would converge to in the absence of any new shocks. We show that current steady- state growth rates can be computed in real time by means of a relatively simple time-varying parameter (TVP) structural vector autoregression model. Our procedure offers a more agnostic estimation of equilibrium growth rates, which is not subject to end-of-sample distortions. Estimates are presented for seven advanced economies and for the euro area.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The estimates show that the steady state GDP growth rate in the case of the United States declined from just above 3% per year back in the 1990s to 2.4% at present. Results for the other six advanced economies and the euro area indicate that the steady-state growth rate, which is consistent with stable inflation and financial conditions, has been relatively stable since 2010 in most cases despite a recent slowdown in actual GDP growth rates.</span></p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We compute steady-state economic growth - defined as the rate of growth that the economy would converge to in the absence of new shocks. This rate can be computed in real-time by means of a parsimonious time-varying parameter (TVP) VAR model. Our procedure offers a relatively agnostic estimation of benchmark equilibrium growth rates. Estimates show that the steady-state GDP growth rate in the case of the United States declined from just above 3% per year in the 1990s to 2.4% at present. Results for other six advanced economies and the euro area indicate that the steady-state growth rate, which is consistent with stable inflation and financial conditions, has been relatively stable since 2010 in most cases in spite of a recent slowdown in actual GDP growth rates.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How might so-called decentralised finance (DeFi) be regulated and supervised? This paper argues that asset tokenisation and the underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT) open up new ways of supervising financial risks. We then put the case for "embedded supervision", a framework that lets compliance with regulatory goals be automatically monitored by reading the market's ledger, thus reducing the need for firms to collect, verify and deliver data.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper sketches out the basic design for embedded supervision. It then models a decentralised financial market and shows under what conditions supervisors can trust the data from a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>DLT enables decentralised financial engineering based on self-executing contracts and deployed atop distributed ledgers such as Ethereum. If such innovations take root, they will drive the development of financial markets through new forms of transparency and data credibility. However, as data credibility in such markets is assured by economic incentives, supervisors need to ensure that the market's economic consensus is strong enough to guarantee the finality of transactions and resultant ownership positions. Only in this case can supervisors trust the quality of the data in the distributed ledger.</p>
<p>To this end, the paper outlines a distributed and permissioned market in which "blocks" of financial contracts are verified by third parties. These verifiers stand to lose a set amount of verification capital should the blockchain ever be reversed, thus voiding existing transactions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper's main result is to show how much capital verifiers would have to stake so that no market participant would ever find it profitable to bribe them into reversing the transaction history. As transactions would then be economically final, supervisors could then trust the distributed ledger's data.</p>
<p>The paper also discusses what kind of legislative and other arrangements would be needed to promote low-cost supervision, data privacy, and a level playing field for both small and large firms. It argues that the main challenges would be to embed the concept of economic finality in the legal system and how to design rules for assigning responsibility in decentralised markets.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The emergence of so-called "decentralised finance" (DeFi) and a shadow financial system of cryptocurrency exchanges and stablecoin issuers raises the challenge of how to apply technology-neutral regulation so that similar risks are subject to the same rules. This paper makes the case for <em>embedded supervision</em>, ie a regulatory framework that provides for compliance in decentralised markets to be automatically monitored by reading the market's ledger. This reduces the need for firms to actively collect, verify and deliver data. The paper explores the conditions under which distributed ledger data may be used to monitor compliance. To this end, a decentralised market is modelled that replaces today's intermediary-based verification of legal data with blockchain-enabled credibility based on economic consensus. The key results set out the conditions under which the market's economic consensus would be strong enough to guarantee that transactions are economically final, so that supervisors can trust the distributed ledger's data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the legislative and operational requirements that would promote low-cost supervision and a level playing field for small and large firms.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Dry-ups in funding markets often lead to financial crises, with adverse macroeconomic consequences. Understanding their dynamics is important. However, isolating the effect of a funding dry-up from broader crisis effects is a challenge for empirical research, as they usually go hand-in-hand. </p>
<p>In this paper, we study the dynamics of funding dry-ups by exploiting a policy reform that resulted in a wholesale funding shortfall in only one market during an otherwise tranquil period.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We uncover a new channel for spillovers of funding dry-ups. When banks face a funding shortage in one market, intensified competition for funds make the effects felt in other funding markets and for other banks as well. The group of banks affected only through spillovers can ultimately suffer the most, raising concerns about their ability to exploit profitable lending opportunities.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The 2016 US money market fund (MMF) reform exogenously reduced unsecured MMF funding for some banks. We use novel data to trace those banks to a platform for corporate deposit funding. We show that intensified competition for corporate deposits spilled the funding squeeze over to other banks with no MMF exposure. These banks paid more for deposits, and their pool of funding providers deteriorated. Moreover, their lending volumes and margins declined and their stocks underperformed. Nevertheless, we find no material change in their riskiness.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Over the past decade, monetary authorities have been confronted by important challenges: persistent deviations of inflation from target in spite of massive monetary easing and several years of robust growth; great uncertainty about the dynamics and drivers of the inflation process; and the important role of factors outside the direct control of central banks. These challenges may pose risks for monetary authorities' credibility, thereby undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy. To understand if this is indeed the case requires assessing whether long-term inflation expectations have remained anchored to the central bank's inflation target.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We shed new light on the anchoring of long-term euro area inflation expectations since the crisis by using micro evidence from a new survey at high (weekly) frequency. We supplement this information with measures based on the whole distribution of inflation expectations from a quarterly survey. We perform a number of statistical tests, which are typically performed on inflation expectations measures extracted from financial instruments, such as inflation swaps.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In contrast to recent evidence from market-based measures of inflation expectations, we find that long-term inflation expectations remained well anchored to the ECB's inflation aim, which has acted as a focal point. We find only subtle signs of long-term inflation expectations not being perfectly well-anchored.</p>

We find that long-term inflation expectations remained well anchored to the ECB's inflation aim, which has acted as a focal point. By contrast, we find no evidence that professional forecasts (reported by Consensus Economics) acted as focal points. But there are subtle signs of long-term inflation expectations not being perfectly well-anchored. Using measures based on the distribution of inflation expectations from a quarterly survey, namely uncertainty based on the full distribution, the probability of expected long-term inflation lying between 1.5% and 2.5%, and the effect of short-term on long-term deflation risk, we find that long-term euro area inflation expectations have remained well-anchored, and have become better-anchored between 2011 and 2018.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>One basic role of international financial markets is to share risks across economies. For instance, investors swap the equity of firms at home for those abroad in order to diversify away from sources of loss that are unique to the domestic economy. In an ideal world of complete risk-sharing, domestic investors would bear such a loss only to the extent of their share of world wealth. Thus, a small economy would lay off on the rest of the world almost all risk that is unique to it. Natural disasters pose such a risk. In theory, financial markets might spread their risk around the world to approach the ideal. But how well do they work in practice?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We start with data compiled by Munich Re, a major reinsurer, on the largest natural catastrophes. These give us estimates on the monetary value of the direct losses and the fraction covered by insurance. We then search balance of payments data to identify related receipts of reinsurance payments from the rest of the world. These data let us measure, for the first time, the fraction of the cost that economies share internationally for dozens of disasters. We then decompose the departure from the ideal of perfect international risk-sharing into two parts. The first arises from a lack of insurance in the first place. The second arises because insurers do not reinsure risks to the extent that, in principle, they should.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>This paper finds that individual economies share the cost of natural disasters to a surprisingly small extent. Two big earthquakes hit in 2011. Japan absorbed over nine-tenths of the losses in Japan. New Zealand laid off about half the losses in New Zealand. Japan turns out to be the more typical case. If governments pick up the bill for natural disasters ex post, then they may convert natural risks into fiscal risks.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The losses from the 2011 earthquakes in Japan remained in Japan, while reinsurance spread the losses from that year's New Zealand earthquake to the rest of the world.This paper finds that the Japanese case is more typical: losses from natural disasters are shared internationally to a generally very limited extent. This finding of home bias in disaster risk-bearing poses a puzzle of international risk-sharing. We decompose international risk-sharing into the portion of losses insured and the portion ofinsurance that is internationally re-insured. We find that the failure of international risk-sharing begins at home with low participation in insurance. Regression analysis points to economic development and institutional/legal quality as important determinants of insurance participation. We propose a new method to measure international reinsurance payments with balance of payments data. This method identifies for the first time the cross-border flow of reinsurance payments to 88 economies that experienced insured disasters in the 1985-2017 period. Regression analysis of these data points to small size and de facto financial integration as positively related to the reinsurance share, as one might expect. However, we also find that more internationally wealthy economies reinsure less, suggesting that net foreign assets substitute for international sharing of disaster risk. For advanced economies, a lack of international risk-sharing is correlated with a lack of fiscal space. Thus, the governments under more pressure to provide ex post government insurance through the budget have less room to manoeuvre to do so. At high levels of public debt, a lack of ex ante insurance can turn disaster risk into financial risk.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper examines how the long period of low interest rates has affected the business activities of banks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The new findings draw on data for 113 large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1994-2015. The analysis distinguishes between three types of effect on banks from short-term interest rates - on their income, balance sheets and risk exposures. It weighs the possibility of effects that vary with the level of rates. It also filters out the influence of macroeconomic, regulatory and bank-specific factors.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Low interest rates have prompted banks to shift from interest-generating to fee-generating and trading activities. This has partially offset the fall in banks' returns on lending ("interest margin"). The shift is stronger for low capitalised banks. Banks have also made moderate changes in the way they fund themselves, preferring deposits over short-term borrowing. In addition, they have responded to new regulation by reducing the riskiness of their assets. At the same time, provisions against losses on lending have fallen, which may indicate that potential problem loans are being repeatedly rolled over ("evergreening").</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates how the prolonged period of low interest rates affects bank intermediation activity. We use data for 113 large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies during the period 1994-2015. We find that low interest rates induce banks to shift their activities from interest-generating to fee-related and trading activities. This rebalancing is stronger for low capitalised banks.Banks also moderately adjust their funding structure, away from short-term market funding towards deposits. We observe a concomitant decline in the risk-weighted asset ratio and a reduction in loan-loss provisions, which is consistent with signs of evergreening.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Increasing use of the renminbi outside China by residents of the rest of the world has focused attention on the financial developments that come along with this process. Global use of a currency transforms its money and bond markets, as offshore trading gains weight. When such trading spreads across time zones, so does exchange of the currency against other currencies. How does this diffusion proceed?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>When the dollar, Deutsche mark and yen became widely used currencies, no broad surveys of foreign exchange (FX) tracked their diffusion processes. But, in 2013 and 2016, surveys captured trading in the currencies of major emerging market economies (EMEs) in dozens of locations. This study uses these two Triennial Central Bank Surveys of Foreign Exchange and Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives Market Activity to study the geographical diffusion of nascent international currencies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The study investigates a particular pattern of diffusion. We observe that the geographical distribution of US dollar trading resembles that of the yen, although the two currencies play different roles. We propose that currencies in the process of internationalising converge to the same global distribution. That is, for EME currencies, a lot of trading initially occurs at home and in the nearest big financial centre. Over time, FX trading spreads across the time zones to close the gap between this regional focus and the global distribution. This end-point - an international currency trading everywhere in proportion to other currencies - accords with the key vehicle currency role played by the dollar, particularly in swaps.</p>
<p>We find that the trading of major EME currencies spreads according to this pattern. In particular, the Chinese renminbi, the Mexican peso, the Indian rupee and the Korean won all follow the same pattern. The renminbi shows the fastest diffusion among these. For the renminbi, the Asian centres that had a head start in trading are tending to lose ground to centres in Europe and the Americas.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This paper studies the ongoing diffusion of renminbi trading across the globe, the first such research of an international currency. It analyses the distribution in offshore renminbi trading in 2013 and 2016, using comprehensive data from the Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Market Activity. In 2013, Asian centres favoured by the policy of renminbi internationalisation had big shares in global renminbi trading. In the following three years, renminbi trading seemed to converge to the spatial pattern of all currencies, with a half-life of seven to eight years. The previously most traded emerging market currency, the Mexican peso, shows a similar pattern, although it is converging to the global norm more slowly. Three other major emerging market currencies show a qualitatively similar evolution in the geography of their offshore trading. Overall the renminbi's internationalisation is tracing an arc from the influence of administrative measures to the working of market forces.</span></p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper focuses on six major exchange rate puzzles identified by the literature: the excess volatility of real exchange rates; their excess reaction to the real interest rate differentials; the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) puzzle; the excess persistence of real exchange rates; the exchange rate disconnect puzzle; and the consumption correlation puzzle. We examine the behaviour of real exchange rates among pairs of economies that have rigidly fixed nominal exchange rates, compared with that among economies with floating exchange rates. Our purpose is to see which of the puzzles, if any, are significantly different under rigidly fixed exchange rates versus floating exchange rates.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Differently from previous work, we compare the degree to which the puzzles hold among pairs of economies with floating exchange rates (eg among the pairs of OECD member countries that are not in the euro area) with pairs of economies that have rigidly fixed exchange rates (such as Hong Kong SAR versus the United States and country pairs within the euro area). We also extend the analysis to intra-national data, such as for US states and Canadian and Chinese provinces, and examine at least some of these propositions, depending on data availability. Within national borders, nominal exchange rates are irrevocably fixed, providing the best possible example of fixed exchange rates. The evidence from our analysis may provide clues to the types of model that are useful for resolving the puzzles - and therefore, the types of model that are most useful for open-economy macroeconomic analysis.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results suggest that, for those economies with a rigidly fixed nominal exchange rate arrangement, the excess volatility puzzle of real exchange rates practically disappears or becomes minor for the vast majority of the fixed rate economies; there is less evidence for an excess reaction of the real exchange rate to the real interest rate differential; there is less disconnect between the real exchange rate and the economic fundamentals; and the uncovered interest rate parity appears to hold more frequently in these economies. However, real exchange rates are as persistent in these economies as in the floating-rate economies, and the evidence on risk-sharing shows little difference among countries with fixed versus floating nominal exchange rates.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We examine several major exchange rate puzzles: the excess volatility of real exchange rates; their excess reaction to the real interest rate differentials; the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) puzzle; the excess persistence of real exchange rates; the exchange rate disconnect puzzle; and the consumption correlation puzzle. We examine the behaviour of real exchange rates among pairs of economies that have rigidly fixed nominal exchange rates, eg countries within the euro area, regions in China and Canada, and Hong Kong SAR vis-à-vis the United States, compared with that among non-euro-area OECD economies.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that some of these puzzles are less puzzling under a rigidly fixed exchange rate regime. In particular, real exchange rates appear to have no or little excess volatility; excess reaction of the real exchange rate to real interest rates is less common; there is less disconnect between the real exchange rate and the economic fundamentals; and uncovered interest rate parity appears to hold more frequently in these economies. However, real exchange rates are as persistent in these economies as in the floating rate economies and there appears to be little difference in risk-sharing across countries with fixed versus floating nominal exchange rates. These results may have implications for exchange rate modelling.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In response to the 2008-09 crisis, central banks aggressively cut monetary policy rates and implemented a broad set of unconventional monetary policy measures. We propose a simple framework to analyse the optimal sequencing of standard policy and unconventional measures.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In our model, central banks implement unconventional measures to provide credit to the economy when bank lending is impaired. We seek answers to the following questions. If unconventional measures are used effectively to address financial market impairments, do they also reduce the likelihood that interest rates will reach the effective lower bound? Should central banks use interest rate policy at all, once they have deployed unconventional measures? How long should they optimally keep those measures in place?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our main result is that, when credit spreads rise due to an increase in costs associated with asset liquidation, unconventional measures may be a more efficient tool than standard interest rate policy. Under these specific circumstances, interest rate cuts should be considered only when the scope for unconventional measures is exhausted. Hence, deploying unconventional measures may prevent interest rates from reaching their effective lower bound.</p>

<p>We study the optimal combination of interest rate policy and unconventional monetary policy in a model where agency costs generate a spread between deposit and lending rates. We show that credit policy can be a powerful substitute for interest rate policy. In the face of shocks that negatively affect banks' monitoring efficiency, unconventional measures insulate the real economy from further deterioration in financial conditions and it may be optimal for the central bank not to cut rates to zero. Thus, credit policy lowers the likelihood of hitting the zero bound constraint. Reductions in the policy rates without non-standard measures are suboptimal as they inefficiently force savers to change their intertemporal consumption patterns.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper investigates how the specific characteristics of Peruvian banks can have different effects on the supply of loans, the bank lending channel and the impact of variation in metal prices. The analysis is made for both the domestic and foreign currency, which is a special characteristic of the Peruvian case, and we use loan-level data and information on bank balance sheets. The methodology consists on a panel data model with fixed effect following Jimenez et al. (2012) and Gambacorta and Marques-Ibanez (2011).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Knowing the variables that affect the supply of credit, the effectiveness of the banking lending channel and the effect of metal prices on domestic lending is important for policy decisions. We contribute to the literature of bank lending channel by estimating these relationships considering loans in domestic and foreign currency. A key feature of our paper is the use of loan-level data, which is important because the recent literature on the subject has highlighted the need to use this confidential data to make the results more robust.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results show that well-capitalized, high-liquidity, low-risk, more profitable banks tend to grant more credit, especially in the domestic currency. Moreover, we found evidence that reserve requirements both in domestic and foreign currency are effective in curbing domestic credit in Peru, giving support to the central bank's active use of reserve requirements as a macroprudential tool to smooth the credit cycle. Finally, we found that banks with more diversified funding sources are less affected after a negative commodity price change.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper uses loan-level data from Peru's credit registry to determine how the role of bank-specific characteristics (i.e. bank size, liquidity, capitalization, funding, revenue, and profitability) may affect the supply of credit in domestic and foreign currency. Also, we analyze how these characteristics affect the banks' response to monetary policy shocks. Finally, we assess how the link between bank-specific characteristics and credit supply is affected by global financial conditions and commodity price changes. Our results show that well-capitalized, high-liquidity, low-risk, more profitable banks tend to grant more credit, especially in domestic currency. Moreover, we found evidence that reserve requirements both in domestic and foreign currency are effective in curbing domestic credit in Peru, giving support to the BCRP's active use of RRs as a macroprudential tool to smooth out the credit cycle. Last, we found that banks with more diversified funding sources are less affected after a negative commodity price change.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies how bank characteristics affect the credit supply in Mexico. We analyse how these features influence banks' response to shocks. We compare the conduct of domestic banks to that of foreign banks' subsidiaries active in Mexico. Finally, we study the role of other micro variables (loan, bank-firm relationship, firm, industry) in the credit supply and the transmission of shocks. For this purpose, we use private loan-level data from the Mexican credit registry. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The structure of financial systems in emerging market economies has changed due to the internationalization of banks, technological innovation, shifts in sources of funding, and post-crisis regulatory reforms. In Mexico, these changes have led to high concentration in the banking sector (the seven largest banks have a market share of 80%) and a high involvement of foreign subsidiaries (80% of the banking system's assets). We contribute to the literature on how these changes have affected the drivers of the credit supply in Mexico. In addition, we contribute to the analysis of the main channels through which monetary policy and external shocks affect the credit supply. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that banks that supply more credit are large, well-capitalised, rely on stable sources of funding and have low risk indicators. In general, bank characteristics that have a positive relationship with loan growth shield banks from monetary policy and external shocks. Second, we find that, compared to domestic banks, foreign subsidiaries reduce their credit supply more actively when the economy faces a shock. Finally, loan growth to high-quality creditors with strong banking relationships is greater and less affected by shocks.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use loan-level data from the Mexican credit registry to study how bank-specific characteristics in influence credit supply. We explore how these characteristics affect the transmission of monetary policy and their role in building banks' resilience to external shocks. Then, we compare the response of the credit supply of foreign subsidiaries to that of domestic banks. Finally, we study the impact of other micro characteristics on the credit supply and their influence on the transmission of shocks. Our results highlight the importance of banks' strong balance sheets and stable sources of funding for the provision of credit in Mexico. In general, these characteristics shelter banks from shocks.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper asks how the expansion of Colombian banks overseas affects the strength of the credit channel in Colombia (i.e., how monetary policy influences bank balance sheets). We investigate the effect of Colombian banks' acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, mainly in Central American countries, as this is the most important structural change in the Colombian banking system in recent years.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper contributes to the growing literature that analyses the effect of internationalization on banks, particularly in their loan supply and funding structure. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to look at the influence of Colombian banks' internationalization on 1) the power of monetary policy at the domestic level, 2) banks' balance sheet's credit risk materialization, and 3) the funding structure of banks (that is, their preferences for local funding or for external sources of funds). As our case of study is Colombia, the paper can serve as a guideline for other emerging economies, mainly those based on the traditional deposit-taking and lending schemes.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Through time, we find that Colombian banks with greater financial soundness tended to increase their loan supply, especially in periods of monetary policy tightening. This result is consistent with the widespread belief that healthier intermediaries are more likely to increase the amount of credit available in the economy. Furthermore, results also suggest that international banks (that is, banks that actively operate overseas) reduce their loan supply and charge higher interest rates in times of monetary policy tightening. Moreover, our results suggest that larger international banks with greater loan-loss provisions increase their loan supply, and simultaneously the cost of credit (that is, the interest rate they charge to their debtors). In addition, international banks with strong balance sheets that rely more on short-term funding tend to reduce their loan supply and at the same time lower the cost of credit.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper analyses the extent to which the strength of the credit channel is affected by the expansion of domestic banks abroad, widely considered the most important structural change of Colombia banking system in recent years. Using loan-level quarterly data for the period between 2007 and 2016, we estimate panel specifications that relate changes in the loan amount and the loan interest rates to variations on the domestic policy rate, the number of foreign subordinates of the lender bank and the interaction between the two. The results suggest that the response of international banks (i.e., those that have significantly expanded abroad) in the face of changes to the domestic policy rate is not statistically different to that of purely local banks, while the cost of credit is found to be slightly higher. Even though in principle this could be interpreted to the effect that internationalization has had no significant effect on the potency of the credit channel, the results tend towards a more subtle conclusion. Specifically, in the face of increases in the domestic policy rate, international banks tend to switch more strongly from domestic to foreign sources of funding. Purely local banks are able thus to capture relatively more domestic funding under these conditions, which allows their credit activity to respond to monetary policy on a similar scale to that of international banks. This result supports the idea that banks switch funding activities between their operating jurisdictions depending on monetary policy conditions, and that the internationalization of domestic banks plays a cushioning role for the economy at times when the monetary policy stance changes significantly.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>During the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008-09 banks in the world suffered losses not observed since the Great Depression of 1929. The response from banks regulatory authorities included measures affecting how banks grant loans, react to monetary policy shocks, and respond to global shocks. </p>
<p>In this paper, we study the case of Chile, a small developing economy and exporter of raw materials, which is open to international financial markets. Despite having a sound economic system, the country was still affected by global shocks. </p>
<p>We study how changes in the Chilean banks' characteristics affect the supply of commercial loans. We quantify if these changes affect how monetary policy affects the loans supply. Also, we assess how sensitive banks are to changes in global conditions, i.e., financial uncertainty, liquidity, political uncertainty, and commodity prices. Lastly, we study the differential role of the Chilean publicly owned bank (Banco Estado), in the commercial loans supply.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To this end, we set up a new and unique database for Chilean banks for the period between the first quarter of 2000 and the last quarter of 2016. We focus on commercial loans, which represent about sixty percent of total loans in Chile, meaning that our results are sufficiently general. To the best of our knowledge, no other work before this has studied these questions with a dataset of this kind. Our estimations build on the models in Gambacorta and Marques-Ibanez (2011) and Jimenez et al. (2012).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results indicate that Chilean banks' provisions, retail loans and share of short-term funding have had a significant role in shaping the commercial loans. While provisions have had a negative relationship with the commercial loans, for retail loans and short-term funding the sign is the opposite. Regarding the interaction with monetary policy, better capitalized banks are less sensitive to changes in the monetary policy interest rate, and therefore less likely to affect the loans supply. Finally, we find that Banco Estado played a key role during the aftermath of the GFC, by expanding its loans supply while most other banks did the reverse.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>During the Global Financial Crisis, banks suffered losses on a scale not witnessed since the Great Depression, partly due to two major structural developments in the banking industry; deregulation combined with financial innovation. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the regulatory response concentrated on the Basel III recommendations, raising core capital requirements for banking institutions, which affected their business models and funding patterns. Consequently, these changes have had significant implications for how banks grant loans, how they react to monetary policy shocks, and how they respond to external shocks. We find evidence of significant interactions between the bank lending channel and both monetary and global shocks in Chile. These links have changed significantly after the Global Financial Crisis. In particular, they have been shaped by the counter-cyclical behavior of a state-owned bank.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper evaluates the impacts of monetary policy surprises on credit supply and employment using comprehensive loan and firm-level data from Brazil. Heterogeneities across financial intermediaries are relevant for the transmission of monetary policy at large, in particular, bank capital. However, identification of unexpected monetary policy shocks can be challenging. In this this paper, I rely on a high-frequency identification strategy to disentangle expected and unexpected MP shocks and I estimate the bank lending channel of monetary policy surprises, the amplifying (attenuating) power of bank weakness (strength) in this transmission channel, and related effects on firms' labor demand.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The bank lending channel of monetary policy has been extensively documented, but the typical identification of unexpected monetary shocks usually entails Taylor residuals, a narrative approach, or non-instrumentation at all. Instead, I explore changes in interest rate derivatives immediately after each monetary policy committee announcement for sharper identification. I also document related real effects on firms' outcomes and the amplifying/alleviating power of financial intermediaries' strength in this transmission channel.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>I find that unexpected monetary shocks identified using high-frequency data have both absolute and compositional effects on credit supply and on employment. Non-instrumentation of monetary policy or the use of Taylor residuals leads to attenuated results consistent with an errors-in-variable problem. Monetary policy surprises have strong effects on firms' credit intake and employment outcomes, but firms connected to stronger banks (with 4% higher capital-to-assets ratio) alleviate about one-third of these effects on credit and two-thirds on employment.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates the bank lending-channel of monetary policy (MP) surprises. To identify the effects of MP surprises on credit supply, I take the changes in interest rate derivatives immediately after each MP announcement and bring this high-frequency identification strategy to comprehensive and matched bank-firm data from Brazil. The results are robust and stronger than those obtained with Taylor residuals or the reference rate. Consistently with theory, heterogeneities across financial intermediaries, e.g. bank capital, are relevant. Firms connected to stronger banks mitigate about one third of the effects of contractionary MP on credit and about two thirds on employment.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper summarises the result of a joint research project by five central banks in Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). It evaluates how bank-specific characteristics affect the supply of credit. Each study uses granular credit registry data to disentangle factors affecting credit demand from those affecting credit supply. Since data confidentiality does not allow the data to be pooled, the results are summarised using meta-analysis techniques as the weighted-averaged coefficients of interest reported for each country study.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Banks' activities and business models have undergone many changes in the last decade. Technological innovation, a low interest rate environment and post-crisis regulatory responses have affected how banks finance themselves and grant credit and, more generally, how they run their businesses. We contribute to the literature by studying how these changes have affected the supply of credit in Latin America's five main economies. A second contribution is analysing how these changes have affected banks' responses to monetary policy and global shocks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the supply of credit is greater for banks that are large, well-capitalised, rely more on deposits, and have more stable sources of funding and lower risk indicators. These bank-specific characteristics also shelter banks from monetary policy and global shocks, with their effects varying by the type of shock.</p>

<p>This paper focuses on the recent changes in banking systems and how bank-specific characteristics have affected credit supply in five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). We use detailed credit registry data and apply a common empirical strategy. Since data confidentiality prevents the pooling of the data, we use meta-analysis techniques to summarise the results. We find that large and well-capitalised banks with low risk indicators, stable sources of funding, and a commercial business model generally supply more credit. Such banks are also more sheltered from monetary and global shocks, with the role of specific characteristics varying by the type of shock.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The "trilemma hypothesis" would make it impossible for a country to have, at one and the same time, a fixed foreign exchange rate, free cross-border flows of capital and an independent monetary policy. To test this hypothesis, we estimate Taylor rule-type monetary policy reaction functions for 47 advanced and emerging market economies from January 2002 to December 2018. The Taylor rule-type factors we look at are the lagged policy rate, real-time forecasts for GDP growth and inflation, the VIX index, global commodity prices and the base-country policy rate. Then we assess how sensitive local policy rates are to those in the base country, across different degrees of exchange rate flexibility and capital account openness.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Previous literature on the trilemma suggests that flexible exchange rates increase the freedom of monetary policymakers to set policy rates. More recently, a different strand of the literature suggested that the global financial cycle has an important influence on financial conditions even in economies with flexible exchange rates. Thus, it has been argued that policymakers face a dilemma instead of a trilemma. This paper considers a different mechanism based on the financial channel of exchange rates. In particular, the foreign currency exposures of local borrowers, combined with flexible exchange rates, might amplify spillovers from the monetary policy of the base country. If these spillovers tend to accentuate vulnerabilities, local policymakers may find it best to dampen exchange rate fluctuations by imitating the base country's monetary policy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In line with the traditional trilemma concept, we find that flexible exchange rates and restrictions on capital flows make local policy rates less sensitive to those of the base country. However, we also find evidence that the financial channel of exchange rates makes local policymakers less likely to exploit the monetary autonomy conferred by a flexible exchange rate. In particular, the local policy rate of an economy with a flexible exchange rate will be more sensitive to the base country policy rate when it has negative foreign currency exposures, in particular when these stem from portfolio debt and bank liabilities, and when base country monetary policy is tightened.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We assess the empirical validity of the trilemma or impossible trinity in the 2000s for a large sample of advanced and emerging market economies. To do so, we estimate Taylor rule-type monetary policy reaction functions, relating the local policy rate to real-time forecasts of domestic fundamentals, global variables, as well as the base-country policy rate. In the regressions, we explore variations in the sensitivity of local to base-country policy rates across different degrees of exchange rate flexibility and capital controls. We find that the data are in general consistent with the predictions from the trilemma: both exchange rate flexibility and capital controls reduce the sensitivity of local to base-country policy rates. However, we also find evidence that is consistent with the notion that the financial channel of exchange rates highlighted in recent work reduces the extent to which local policymakers decide to exploit the monetary autonomy in principle granted by flexible exchange rates in specific circumstances: the sensitivity of local to base-country policy rates for an economy with a flexible exchange rate is stronger when it exhibits negative foreign currency exposures which stem from portfolio debt and bank liabilities on its external balance sheet and when base-country monetary policy is tightened. The intuition underlying this finding is that it may be optimal for local monetary policy to mimic the tightening of base-country monetary policy and thereby mute exchange rate variation because a depreciation of the local currency would raise the cost of servicing and rolling over foreign currency debt and bank loans, possibly up to a point at which financial stability is put at risk.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The rapid growth of the global financial system over the past couple of decades has increased the importance of properly measuring contagion risk. This is true not only from a financial stability point of view, but also from a macroeconomic perspective, as financial crises tend to have significant and persistent negative effects on economic activity. At the same time, the increased interconnectedness and complexity of the global banking system have made that task extremely challenging.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a novel methodology for measuring contagion risk in international banking. Our proposed methodology combines information contained in market prices (ie credit default swap (CDS) spreads) with information contained in banks' bilateral (country-level) foreign exposures. We use the rich dimensionality of the BIS international banking statistics to map the financial links among a set of 23 countries into a multi-layer network. The network maps the bilateral foreign claims of each country in three layers, which correspond to foreign claims on (i) the banking sector, (ii) the official sector and (iii) the non-bank private sector.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our empirical analysis suggests that the measure generated using our novel methodology predicts CDS spreads better than an alternative measure based on past values of CDS spreads. This is the case, especially during crisis times, when the non-linear network effects tend to be more important.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We propose a distress measure for national banking systems that incorporates not only banks' CDS spreads, but also how they interact with the rest of the global financial system via multiple linkage types. The measure is based on a tensor decomposition method that extracts an adjacency matrix from a multi-layer network, measured using banks' foreign exposures obtained from the BIS international banking statistics. Based on this adjacency matrix, we develop a new network centrality measure that can be interpreted in terms of a banking system's credit risk or funding risk.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Unemployment is one of the most important economic risks faced by individuals. For this reason, governments provide unemployment insurance (UI) to their citizens by providing a certain level of income for a limited time during the spell of unemployment. At the macro level, UI is regarded as an efficient fiscal policy tool that smooths business cycles. However, to the extent that UI lowers individual and macroeconomic risks, it should reduce precautionary savings by households, and hence bank deposits. As deposits are the main stable source of funding for banks, more generous UI may also erode bank lending.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Discussions about the costs and benefits of UI policies have focused mainly on enhanced consumer welfare or the distorting effects on job search and job creation. Our findings suggest that UI policies could also have large negative macroeconomic implications via their effects on bank funding and lending.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show by using disaggregated US data that in response to a one standard deviation increase in state UI benefits, a county's total deposits declines by 2.2%. This fall in deposits leads banks to squeeze their commercial lending, which in turn lowers corporate investment.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Many countries provide unemployment insurance (UI) to reduce individuals' income risk and to moderate fluctuations in the economy. However, to the extent that these policies are successful, they would be expected to reduce precautionary savings and hence bank deposits--households' main saving instrument. In this paper, we study this reduced incentive to save and uncover a novel distortionary mechanism through which UI policies affect the economy. In particular, we show that, when UI benefits become more generous, bank deposits fall. Since deposits are the main stable funding source for banks, this fall in deposits squeezes bank commercial lending, which in turn reduces corporate investment.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Why are interest rates so low today? Many believe that the worldwide abundance of savings is due to the retirement of OECD baby-boomers and the Chinese one-child policy. Can these factors explain the fall in long-term real interest rates, from around 4.5% in 1990 to around 0% since 2015? By contrast, the return on capital, defined as profits over the stock of capital, if anything, increased from 1990 to 2000 and remained stable at around 10% until 2015. Why do investors accept such low returns on bonds while, at the same time, the return on physical capital has remained stable?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our model features all the potential causes for the decline in real interest rates: demography, trend productivity and risk. In it, generations can save either by lending to the younger generation or by purchasing firms that produce goods and generate profits. The return on stocks is risky because firms' productivity can vary over time. The model is calibrated to simulate the long-term evolution of interest rates, the return on capital, economic growth and the level of debt in the United States, the euro area and the world economy for the last 50 years. It lets us identify and quantify the factors that led to the decline in real interest rates.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Only one factor can explain why both risk premia and debt levels have increased. This is a change in risk perception, which in the model takes the form of uncertainty about the growth rate of productivity. We show that even a moderate increase in the standard deviation of the year-on-year growth rate of productivity, say, from 0.08% to 0.1%, can explain why the difference between return-on-capital and the real interest rate has increased from 3.5% in 1990 to 10% today.</p>
<p>For an average long-term growth rate in productivity of 2%, a growth rate that fluctuates somewhere between 1.8% and 2.2% leads investors to hold a much larger proportion of "safe asset/debt" in their portfolio than if this growth rate were to fluctuate between 1.84% and 2.16%. While these changes seem small, their effects on growth rates can be large when cumulated over an entire generation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, once the effect of rising uncertainty on growth is taken into account, the equilibrium interest rate falls even without any deleveraging. Indeed, according to our model, explaining a 3% fall in real interest rates only by deleveraging would require that debt has been halved since 1990. This is in sharp contrast with the data, since debts as a share of GDP have actually increased since 1990. Finally, ageing and the decline in productivity since 1990 account for only a small proportion of the decline in real interest rates.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Risk-free rates have been falling since the 1980s while the return on capital has not. We analyse these trends in a calibrated overlapping-generations model with recursive preferences, designed to encompass many of the "usual suspects" cited in the debate on secular stagnation. Deleveraging cannot account for the joint decline in the risk free rate and increase in the risk premium, and declining labour force and productivity growth imply only a limited decline in real interest rates. If we allow for a change in the (perceived) risk to productivity growth to fit the data, we find that the decline in the risk-free rate requires an increase in the borrowing capacity of the indebted agents in the model, consistent with the increase in the sum of public and private debt since the crisis.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We propose a simple framework to explain low global real risk-free interest rates. We use a global resource constraint to link real rates with consumption and wealth. This relationship serves as an empirical framework to explain past secular declines of the risk-free rate, as well as to project its future trend.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We highlight the importance of the consumption-to-wealth ratio in explaining the real interest rate. Different decompositions of the ratio nest various mechanisms proposed in the literature, such as productivity decline, demographic developments, and deleveraging. The framework enables testing of these hypotheses with few theoretical assumptions. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The consumption-to-wealth ratio predicts future movements of the global real risk-free rate. The roaring 1920s and exuberant 2000s were both marked by a rapid decline in the consumption-to-wealth ratio, with both ending in a low rate environment. This experience points to the role of the boom-bust leveraging cycle during the two episodes. Empirical estimates forecast persistently low or negative real global interest rates in the foreseeable future.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The current environment is characterized by low real rates and by policy rates close to or at their effective lower bound in all major €nancial areas. We analyze these unusual economic conditions from a secular perspective using data on aggregate consumption, wealth and asset returns. Our present-value approach decomposes fluctuations in the global consumption-to-wealth ratio over long periods of time and show that this ratio anticipates future movements of the global real risk-free rate. Our analysis identifies two historical episodes where the consumption-to-wealth ratio declined rapidly below its historical average: in the roaring 1920s and again in the exuberant 2000s. Each episode was followed by a severe global €financial crisis and depressed real rates for an extended period of time. Our empirical estimates suggest that the world real rate of interest is likely to remain low or negative for an extended period of time.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper discusses why the financial system is not as resilient as policymakers currently claim - despite extensive regulatory reforms from a very weak starting point.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper discusses different policy strategies for making some of the debt of some banks "information-insensitive", so that they it would be treated as safe in all but the most stressed circumstances. For the current prudential strategy, which is centred on minimum equity requirements, the paper argues that central banks and other agencies should start publishing annual staff reports on where regulatory and supervisory policy has been surreptitiously tightened or loosened.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper aims to spark and contribute to the debate on the second phase of stability reforms that will be needed. It sets out an alternative policy strategy based on 100% liquidity cover for the short-term debt of banks (and shadow banks), and for the creditor hierarchy of operating banks and holding companies. In this proposal, the haircut policy of central banks would become the key instrument in determining bank equity requirements and the terms on which they could borrow in secured money markets. As such, this strategy would operationalise the theoretical and empirical work of Bengt Holmström and Gary Gorton.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper assesses whether globalisation should be included more comprehensively in models that forecast and explain inflation. The world economy has changed in ways which imply that global factors play a greater role in price dynamics. Key changes include greater trade flows, the greater heft of emerging markets and their impact on commodity prices, and the greater use of supply chains to shift production to cheaper locations. The increased role of these global factors could also reduce the bargaining power of local workers.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Standard inflation models do not sufficiently capture these aspects of globalisation, as they tend to focus on domestic factors (such as spare production capacity ("slack") in the domestic economy and inflation expectations). Over the past decade, such models have done a poor job of explaining sharp movements in inflation in major economies. Improving them is critically important in order to better predict inflation and set monetary policy appropriately. This paper shows that a more comprehensive treatment of global factors can meaningfully improve our ability to understand how inflation evolves.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>This paper uses three very different approaches to evaluate the role of global factors in the inflation process: a principal components analysis, a Phillips-curve based framework, and a trend-cycle decomposition. The results suggest that global factors, including exchange rates, oil prices, other commodity prices, slack in major economies (not just at home) and international pricing competition, can all be important determinants of inflation. Although results vary across individual countries, the role of these global factors in explaining CPI inflation rates has increased over the last decade. These results suggest that economists should not throw away the old models of inflation, but add a more comprehensive treatment of international factors and allow their role to vary over time.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The relationship central to most inflation models, between slack and inflation, seems to have weakened. Do we need a new framework? This paper uses three very different approaches - principal components, a Phillips curve model, and trend-cycle decomposition - to show that inflation models should more explicitly and comprehensively control for changes in the global economy and allow for key parameters to adjust over time. Global factors, such as global commodity prices, global slack, exchange rates, and producer price competition can all significantly affect inflation, even after controlling for the standard domestic variables. The role of these global factors has changed over the last decade, especially the relationship between global slack, commodity prices, and producer price dispersion with CPI inflation and the cyclical component of inflation. The role of different global and domestic factors varies across countries, but as the world has become more integrated through trade and supply chains, global factors should no longer play an ancillary role in models of inflation dynamics.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper examines how bank internationalisation might influence bank performance. Using bank-level information for 113 countries over the 2000-15 period, we consider how bank internationalisation is related to bank valuation, risk and return. As international banks from developing countries have recently expanded strongly, we also focus on whether these banks perform differently to international banks based in high-income countries. Finally, we study how internationalising banks may differ in terms of their business models and funding strategies, as well as how far their lending volume varies with the business cycle in their home country and in any foreign country where they have a subsidiary.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper adds to the literature investigating the impact of bank internationalisation by analysing data at the consolidated bank level during the 2000-15 period, which includes the crisis period and its aftermath. In examining the implications of bank internationalisation, we distinguish between banks headquartered in developing countries and high-income countries.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that bank internationalisation has generally been associated with lower bank valuation as measured by Tobin's Q and the market-to-book value of equity. In part, this reflects a lower return on equity. But internationalising banks from developing countries did better, were valued more highly, were less risky and enjoyed higher returns when active in a greater number of countries. Following the financial crisis, international banks performed better than domestic banks, as reflected in higher market valuations, a lower non-performing loans ratio and a higher return on assets. For international banks headquartered in developing countries, our results indicate that bank internationalisation reduces the cyclicality of their domestic credit growth with respect to home country GDP growth, smoothing local downturns. In contrast, if the international bank is from a high-income country and invests in a developing country, its lending tends to vary more strongly with the business cycle, which can be destabilising.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper provides evidence on how bank performance and strategies vary with the degree of bank internationalization, using data for 113 countries over 2000-15. Over this period, bank internationalization is associated with lower valuations and lower returns on equity. However, developing country banks that internationalized seem to have fared better than their high-income counterparts. Following the crisis, international banks were revalued particularly if they had stable funding in the form of deposits and if they had more generous deposit insurance coverage. Furthermore, for international banks headquartered in developing countries, our results indicate that bank internationalization reduces the cyclicality of their domestic credit growth with respect to home country gross domestic product growth, smoothing local downturns. In contrast, if the international bank is from a high-income country investing in a developing country, its lending is relatively procyclical, which can be destabilizing.</p>

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We use novel, individual-level survey data across several countries to quantify inflation and deflationary biases in inflation expectations that emerge due to a loss in confidence in the central bank's price objective.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We develop a model that can accommodate both inflation and deflationary biases, and then test the model's prediction using the survey data. The model lets us dissect country-level results on inflation and deflationary bias and interpret them as a result of different perceptions of the target level of the output gap or different relative weights attached to output and inflation in the perception of the central bank's loss function. This feature is particularly useful for evaluating the differences in perceptions within the European monetary union.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results show that both inflation and deflationary biases are present and sizeable. For our sample of countries, we find that those that pursue inflation targeting have lower inflation expectations as well as lower dispersion of inflation expectations. However, our results also show that the deflationary bias may become even larger under an inflation targeting regime. </p>
<p>Our results reveal substantial differences among European monetary union countries in terms of their perceptions of the ECB's objective function. The perception of the target level of the output gap, for example, is highest in Italy. The differences among other countries are mostly driven by the different relative weights attached to output and inflation. These results indicate that the ECB faces an ongoing challenge in convincing households of their objectives.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We explore the consequences of losing confidence in the price-stability objective of central banks by quantifying the inflation and deflationary biases in inflation expectations. In a model with an occasionally binding zero-lower-bound constraint, we show that both inflation bias and deflationary bias can exist as a steady-state outcome. We assess the predictions of this model using unique individual-level inflation expectations data across nine countries that allow for a direct identification of these biases. Both inflation and deflationary biases are present and sizable, but different across countries. Even among the euro-area countries, perceptions of the European Central Bank's objectives are very distinct.</p>

<p><em>Paper produced as part of the BIS Consultative Council for the Americas Research Network project "<a href="/am_office/rsn/erkdeit.htm">Exchange rates: key drivers and effects on inflation and trade</a>"</em></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">I analyse the relationship at the industry level between the exchange rate pass-through to export and import prices and volumes and the use of imported inputs in production.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper contributes to the literature on incomplete pass-through and its determinants. Specifically, I focus on the role of imported inputs in determining trade prices and volumes, for both exports and imports. I analyse two separate sources of heterogeneity in the effects of imported inputs: the share of imports in total input purchases; and the elasticity of output with respect to intermediate inputs (the relative importance of inputs for production). Although I use detailed firm-level data for my estimations, the relationship between the use of imported inputs and the exchange rate pass-through is examined at the industry level. The sector-level analysis can be useful for policymakers whenever detailed firm-level data are not available.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Using microdata from Colombia, I find significant variations in industries' use of imported inputs that can be explained mainly by differences in the share of imported inputs in firms' total input purchases. The exchange rate pass-through to export prices varies significantly across industries as well. The pass-through estimates correlate positively with the use of imported inputs at the two-digit manufacturing industry level: industries with a larger share of imported inputs tend to have a higher exchange rate pass-through to both export and import prices. The correlation is stronger for export prices, but the effect on the pass-through to import prices is also positive. I also find that the response of exported and imported quantities to changes in the exchange rate varies across industries, but I do not find a clear correlation between the estimated elasticities and the use of imported inputs.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In the presence of price rigidities, nominal exchange rate fluctuations can have real effects on the economy. External shocks may have differentiated effects across economic sectors depending on firms' marginal cost structure and features of the demand they face, such as strategic complementarities. I analyse the relationship between the exchange rate pass-through to export and import prices and volumes and the use of imported inputs in production, an important determinant of marginal cost. Using microdata from Colombia, I show that manufacturing industries differ significantly in their use of imported inputs and in the estimated exchange rate pass-through. I find a clear correlation between the use of imported inputs and the response of prices to changes in exchange rates. That is, the exchange rate pass-through to prices tends to be larger for industries in which firms use a larger share of imported inputs. The link is stronger in the case of exports, but the effect on the pass-through to import prices is also positive. In contrast, I do not find a clear correlation between the use of imported inputs and the response of traded quantities to changes in exchange rates.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Reduced form models that explain total exports with real effective exchange rates (REERs) are widely used in applied policy work, but their analytical structures are only loosely based on international trade theory. Incorrect aggregation of theory-consistent bilateral trade equations implies that estimations performed on aggregate data lead to bias in the underlying elasticties. Models calibrated with these elasticities will have predictions at odds with the implication of their bilateral counterparts.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper shows that the standard REER approach constitutes an approximation, which holds only for small changes, and causes an aggregation bias. We propose a new alternative regression specification that produces unbiased estimates. In our specification, aggregate exports are a function of the real exchange rate (RER) and foreign demand deflated by the destination-specific price index all denominated in an international currency as postulated by the dominant currency paradigm. If prices are set in the producer or the local currency, the estimation of the aggregate elasticities without bias is only possible if exchange rate pass-through is complete. To reveal the importance of theory-consistent aggregation for parameter inference, we resort to theoretical model simulations and quantify the magnitude of the aggregation bias in standard REER regressions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our simulation results show that aggregation bias in standard REER regressions is substantial (around 10 percent) and increases with measurement errors. The fact that many macroeconomic models are calibrated with these elasticities has important policy implications. The predictions of these models exaggerate the response of exports and, by extension, output following an exchange rate shock. Calibrating these models with elasticities estimated from our new estimation equation with variables denominated in the dominant international currency (ie, US dollar) improves the model's fit and results in predictions consistent with microeconomic behavior in bilateral trade equations.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper shows that real effective exchange rate (REER) regressions, the standard approach for estimating the response of aggregate exports to exchange rate changes, imply biased estimates of the underlying elasticities. We provide a new aggregate regression specification that is consistent with bilateral trade flows micro-founded by the gravity equation. This theory-consistent aggregation leads to unbiased estimates when prices are set in an international currency as postulated by the dominant currency paradigm. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to compare elasticity estimates based on this new "ideal-REER" regression against typical regression specifications found in the REER literature. The results show that the biases are small (around 1 percent) for the exchange rate and large (around 10 percent) for the demand elasticity. We find empirical support for this prediction from annual trade flow data. The difference between elasticities estimated on the bilateral and the aggregate levels reduce significantly when applying an ideal-REER regression rather than a standard REER approach.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper discusses whether Law 28300 of 2004, that required Peruvian firms to express their prices in Peru's currency in a context of high price dollarization, affected the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). We hypothesize that the enactment of the Law introduced menu costs for firms that used to set their prices in dollars, prompting several of them to make a permanent switch to pricing in local currency. Using disaggregated consumer price index (CPI) data, we find that, following passage of the Law, the ERPT was completely offset for non-durable goods with dollarized prices, and partially offset for durable goods with dollarized prices. These effects may vary due to differences in imported component shares, market power, and markup pricing. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We study the exchange rate pass-through to import prices at the dock using detailed customs data for Chile. We quantify the contribution of the invoice currency vis-à-vis the exporter's currency in determining the exchange rate pass-through at different time horizons.</span></p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>A depreciation of a country's currency results in more expensive imports, which ultimately trickles down to retail prices. This study is motivated by a related concern on the part of central banks, namely: what exchange rate parity is relevant to identify those inflation pressures going forward - the US dollar (USD) or that of the main trading partners? A characterisation of the exchange rate pass-through to import prices is a necessary step in addressing this question directly. The answer also helps shed light on other important aspects of international business cycles. For example, it helps us understand the implications of a global strengthening of the USD for international trade flows and economic activity.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that import prices are sensitive to changes in the value of the USD in the short run, but the exporter currency matters more in the medium term. Specifically, a depreciation of the domestic currency against the USD immediately increases the price of imports in Chilean pesos. This is due to the fact that a large majority of Chilean imports are invoiced in USD regardless of their origin - something we document in our work. With time, as new trade contracts are signed, prices in USD are adjusted to reflect the new conditions, easing the initial pressures on import prices. Within two years, the exchange rate parity with respect to the country of origin of imports gains relevance in determining import prices. Among other things, this implies that a global appreciation of the USD has inflationary pressures in the short run, but that multilateral depreciations matter most within a two-year horizon.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use transaction-level customs data to document that a large majority of Chilean imports are invoiced in dollars regardless of country of origin and sector. We study the implications of this fact for the determination of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to border prices. We find that the special role of the dollar in international trade has real effects, but bilateral exchange rates with respect to exporter currencies also matter in the medium-term. In particular, exchange rate fluctuations against the dollar account for most of the ERPT in the short run and are still relevant after two years. However, the cumulative ERPT with respect to the exporter country's currency increases with time and after two years accounts for most of the ERPT to border prices.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The US dollar is the most common currency of choice for debt contracts. Dollar-denominated credit to non-banks outside the United States amounts to around $11.5 trillion. While the dominance of the dollar declined prior to 2008, the currency has strengthened its international role since then.</p>
<p>We develop a model to study how a dominant currency emerges. Guided by our results, we show empirically why it is the dollar, and why the dollar's dominance may have declined and recovered in the last two decades.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a "debt view" to explain the dollar's dominant role internationally. The model has nominal debt as the main driver and assigns an important role to monetary policy and exchange rates. Expansionary monetary policy in downturns alleviates financial distress through its effects on inflation and exchange rates. We provide broad empirical support for our mechanism, analysing currency choices over time and across currencies, including evidence using granular bond issuance data.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif; color: #372f32;">Theoretically, the dominant currency is the one that: (i) depreciates in global downturns over horizons of typical debt maturity; and (ii) has the steepest nominal yield curve. We show empirically that the dollar fits this description better than other major currencies. Monetary policy is a key determinant in the choice of the dominant currency. Expansionary monetary policy in global downturns lowers the real debt burdens of firms through its impact on inflation and exchange rates. The debt view can explain dollar debt issuance patterns over the past two decades. It also offers insights into the future of the dollar's dominance in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.</span></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central banks increasingly use macroprudential tools. These tools interact with monetary policy in affecting credit supply and thereby the economy. Yet studying this interaction is difficult, because monetary policy and macroprudential tools work in a similar way and address similar objectives.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our main contribution is to identify the interaction of monetary and macroprudential policies in international bank lending. This is challenging to do within a single country, given the similarities between the two types of policy. We focus on cross-border lending in three reserve currencies: the US dollar, the euro and the yen. The monetary policies associated with these three currencies are independent of domestic macroprudential policies used in the home country of the lending bank. As an example, we look at how US monetary policy interacts with UK macroprudential policy in affecting cross-border bank lending from UK banks to borrowers in foreign countries, such as Malaysia. Using a rarely accessed BIS data set, we exclude observations where independence is not guaranteed. In the previous example, we exclude the United States both as a home banking system and as a borrowers' country. This allows us to study precisely how the two policies work together.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find significant policy interaction. Tighter UK macroprudential policy mitigates the negative (positive) impact of US monetary policy tightening (easing) on US dollar cross-border lending from UK banks. Conversely, easier macroprudential policy amplifies the impact of monetary policy. The results imply that this interaction has an economically and statistically significant impact on cross-border loan supply.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We combine a rarely accessed BIS database on bilateral cross-border lending flows with cross-country data on macroprudential regulations. We study the interaction between the monetary policy of major international currency issuers (USD, EUR and JPY) and macroprudential policies enacted in source (home) lending banking systems. We find significant interactions. Tighter macroprudential policy in a home country mitigates the impact on lending of monetary policy of a currency issuer. For instance, macroprudential tightening in the UK mitigates the negative impact of US monetary tightening on USD-denominated cross-border bank lending outflows from UK banks. Vice-versa, easier macroprudential policy amplifies impacts. The results are economically significant.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study how firms form inflation expectations in an environment of relatively high and volatile inflation, as is the case of many developing economies. This is in contrast to previous studies that focus on developed countries.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Survey data on firms' inflation expectations are scarce, despite the role of firms as price setters. We first provide evidence on how firms form their inflation expectations and how this is affected by the acquisition of new information, focusing on Uruguay - a country with a history of high and volatile inflation. Second, we provide evidence on how inflation prospects are affected by the acquisition of information about past inflation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that firms generally have persistent forecast errors, that many firms do not revise their expectations frequently and that there is substantial disagreement about future inflation across firms. Looking at firm characteristics, we find that small firms' forecast errors and disagreement about future inflation are larger than those of medium and large firms, and that there is variation in 12-month ahead inflation and average forecast errors across industrial sectors. Our results also suggest that in the months of wage adjustment, on average, firms that adjust their wages expect future inflation to be lower than those that do not adjust wages. We also show that firms' inflation forecasts are more accurate and that there is less disagreement across firms about future inflation at the time of wage adjustments. All these results indicate that the acquisition of information by firms affects their beliefs about future inflation.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using data from a unique and novel monthly firm-level survey on inflation expectations in Uruguay we first present stylized facts about the inflation expectation formation process and then show how information acquisition affects firms' inflation expectations. We show that firms' forecasts are close to observed inflation, that a sizable proportion of firms do not revise their expectations, and that there is substantial disagreement about future inflation among firms. We also present evidence on industrial sector effects on inflation forecasts and show that the correlation between inflation expectations and cost expectations increases with the forecast time horizon. We then exploit peculiarities of the collective wage bargaining negotiation mechanism to estimate the impact of acquiring information about past inflation on expected future inflation. Our results imply that firms that adjust wages expect lower inflation, revise their expectations downwards and make smaller forecast errors than firms that do not adjust wages. We find no effect of wage adjustments on firms' own cost expectations and that disagreement among firms is lower in the months of wage adjustment. The latter suggests that inflation expectations tend to converge as firms are more informed about past inflation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How is mortgage credit affected by macroprudential regulation? We look at how a change in regulation affecting loan loss provisions for mortgage credit risk affected the Chilean mortgage credit market.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>A growing body of literature has established that macroprudential policies subdue fast growth of mortgage credit and house prices. Most of those analyses have relied on cross-country data, but cross-country average effects are not enough for individual countries to take a decision on implementation, which can be costly. Evaluating macroprudential tools based on evidence from micro data complements the cross-country approach. We help fill this gap in the literature.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We consider the change in the required loan loss provisions for credit risk, which were implemented in the Chilean mortgage market in January 2016. First, we glean a number of lessons to guide our empirical analysis from a stylised model of imperfect information. Second, by using detailed administrative tax records on the census of all real estate transactions in Chile between 2012 and 2017, we find that the change in regulation did have an effect on newly granted loans: they were smaller as a fraction of pledged collateral. Finally, using our stylised model we find an implicit loan-to-value limit at the 80% threshold. This prediction is supported robustly by the evidence in the data.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We argue that financial institutions responded by raising their acceptable borrowing standards on borrowers, enhancing the quality of their portfolio, but also contracting their supply of mortgage credit. We reach this conclusion by developing a stylized imperfect information model which we use to guide our empirical analysis. We conclude that the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio was 2.8% lower for the mean borrower, and 9.8% lower for the median borrower, because of the regulation. Our paper contributes to the literature on the evaluation of macro-prudential policies, which has mainly exploited cross-country evidence. In turn, our analysis narrows down to one particular policy in the mortgage market, and dissects its effects by exploiting unique administrative tax data on the census of all real estate transactions in Chilean territory, in the period 2012-2016.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper investigates the entry of big technology companies (BigTech) into financial services. It seeks to address three questions: What economic forces are driving this development? Do BigTech lenders have an information advantage compared with traditional data or processing methods, particularly when gauging creditworthiness? Do firms receiving BigTech credit perform differently from competitors?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper reports findings based on exclusive data from BigTech lenders to provide both an overview and new cross-country evidence on BigTech activities in finance. Analysis that draws on detailed data from China's Ant Financial and Latin America's Mercado Libre sheds light on key questions about this potentially game-changing development in the world of finance.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Differences in the development of FinTech credit reflect differences in income and financial market structure. The higher a country's income and the less competitive its banking system, the larger the FinTech credit volume. BigTech credit benefits even more from these factors. Looking at credit scoring, data from Mercado Libre show that credit models using machine learning and data from the e-commerce platform are better at predicting losses than traditional credit bureau ratings. Finally, using detailed micro data from Mercado Libre and Ant Financial, the authors find that small firms in Argentina that used BigTech credit offered more products and had higher sales than competitors, and that small firms in China also offered more products.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We consider the drivers and implications of the growth of "BigTech" in finance - ie the financial services offerings of technology companies with established presence in the market for digital services. BigTech firms often start with payments. Thereafter, some expand into the provision of credit, insurance, and savings and investment products, either directly or in cooperation with financial institution partners. Focusing on credit, we show that BigTech firms lend more in countries with less competitive banking sectors and less stringent regulation. Analysing the case of Argentina, we find support for the hypothesis that BigTech lenders have an information advantage in credit assessment relative to a traditional credit bureau. For borrowers in both Argentina and China, we find that firms that accessed credit expanded their product offerings more than those that did not. It is too early to judge the extent of BigTech's eventual advance into the provision of financial services. However, the early evidence allows us to pose pertinent questions that bear on their impact on financial stability and overall economic welfare.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper assesses how informality affects inflation dynamics and monetary policy. Informality is captured by a dual labour market where the share of informal workers is driven by market demand and adjusts quickly. Only formal sector ﬁrms have access to ﬁnancing, which is necessary for their production process. These elements are embedded in a standard general equilibrium framework with a Taylor rule for monetary policy. We explore the impact of different shocks on the dynamics of inflation and how the transmission channel of monetary policy is affected by informality.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Informality is still an entrenched structural trait in emerging market economies. Informality determines the behaviour of labour markets, ﬁnancial access and the productivity of the overall economy. Therefore, it inﬂuences the transmission of shocks and also of monetary policy. However, there is hardly research analysing the link between informality and monetary policy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Informality provides higher flexibility to the labour market and buffers the impact of shocks on wages. Informality also operates through the credit cost channel: as the informal sector is excluded from credit markets, the sensitivity of unit costs to changes in interest rates is reduced. The paper has two main results: 1) the informal sector mitigates inﬂationary pressures arising from demand and ﬁnancial shocks (but not of technology shocks); 2) the informal sector dampens the transmission channel of monetary policy: policy interventions are less eﬀective in stabilising inﬂation and the sacriﬁce ratio is higher. Less effectiveness implies that monetary policy must react more strongly to deviations from inflation, but deviations would be smaller under most of the shocks. So, does informality facilitates inflation stability, making the job of monetary policy easier? At the light of our results, the answer is inconclusive.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Informality is an entrenched structural trait in emerging market economies, despite of the progress achieved in macroeconomic management. Informality determines the behavior of labour markets, financial access and the productivity of the overall economy. Therefore it influences the transmission of shocks and also of monetary policy. This paper develops a simple general equilibrium closed economy model with nominal rigidities, labor and financial frictions. Informality is captured by a dual labour market where the share of informal workers is endogenous. Only formal sector firms have access to financing, which is instrumental in their production process. Informality has a buffering effect on the propagation of demand and supply shocks to prices; the financial feature of the model exacerbates the impact of financial shocks in the formal sector while the informal sector is in principle unaffected. As a result informality dampens the impact of demand and financial shocks on wages and inflation but heighten the impact of technology shocks. Informality also increases the sacrifice ratio of monetary policy actions. From a Central Bank perspective, the results imply that the presence of an informal sector mitigates inflation volatility for some type of shocks but makes monetary policy less effective.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We examine the prevailing view that only saving and investment drivers influence the long-term evolution of real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates. That view also relies on the notion of a natural, or equilibrium, real interest rate that is independent of monetary policy. By contrast, we argue that monetary factors matter.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We test the role of saving and investment drivers based on a large set of advanced economies since the 1870s. We also examine the popular hypothesis that a shortage of risk-free, or "safe" assets, has led to an excess of saving over investment and driven down real interest rates. We compare the relevance of these factors with that of monetary ones. To shed light on the findings, we propose a novel model where monetary factors play a key role by interacting with the financial cycle.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our analysis finds prevailing explanations of low real interest rates wanting. By contrast, it indicates that shifts in monetary policy regimes play a greater role. In our stylised model, monetary policy affects an economy's vulnerability to a financial bust by influencing the boom. It thus helps determine the long-run path of output and real interest rates. Our findings raise questions about the usefulness of the natural interest rate as a policy guide. They also suggest that monetary policy cannot ignore financial booms and busts.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The paper takes a critical look at the conceptual and empirical underpinnings of prevailing explanations for low real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates over long horizons and finds them incomplete. The role of monetary policy, and its interaction with the financial cycle in particular, deserve greater attention. By linking booms and busts, the financial cycle generates important path dependencies that give rise to intertemporal policy trade-offs. Policy today constrains policy tomorrow. Far from being neutral, the policy regime can exert a persistent influence on the economy's evolution, including on the real interest rate. This raises serious conceptual and practical questions about the use of the natural interest rate as a monetary policy guidepost. In developing the analysis, the paper also provides a specific critique of the safe asset shortage hypothesis - a hypothesis that has gained considerable popularity in recent years.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How do we explain low inflation? Inflation has remained low in many advanced economies in spite of declining unemployment rates and steady increases in employment. At the same time, the workforce is ageing. Baby boomers are working longer than their parents. Over the last 15 years, the proportion of people aged 55 to 64 who work has increased from 33% to 55% on average across the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development countries. In Germany, it increased from 40% to 70%. We look at how this ageing may affect wage inflation.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This is the first paper to analyse the channels through which an increase in the labour supply by older workers could impact wages. A first channel is the relative wages of old and young workers. As wages typically increase with seniority, a higher proportion of older worker should lift wages overall. A second channel is that older workers' willingness to keep working increases the supply of workers and reduces the equilibrium wage. We estimate the net effects of workers ageing on wages both in panels of countries and in a panel of 200 European regions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that, over the last 20 years, the ageing of the workforce has reduced wage inflation. This result holds true across all the economies we tested, from the G7 advanced economies to small European regions. But the effects are small, perhaps because we estimate the net effects of two channels that work in opposite directions. </p>
<p>We also find that unemployment has a large impact on wage inflation: "Reducing the unemployment rate by 1% increases wage inflation by 0.45% in G7 countries and 0.25% in euro area countries". These effects, which are highly statistically significant, have declined since 2010 in the G7 panel estimates but not in the euro area countries. </p>
<p>In view of these estimates, the current situation of low wage inflation and low unemployment implies that the unemployment rate gives only a partial picture of the amount of slack in the labour market.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Why is wage inflation so weak in spite of the recent sharp reduction in unemployment? We show that this may be due to an ongoing change in the composition of the labor supply. Indeed, the participation rate of workers aged between 55 and 64 has increased steadily over the last decade, from a third to above a half on average across OECD countries. This is most likely the consequence of ageing and the reform of pensions. We show that the participation rate of workers aged 55 to 64 contributes to explain why wage inflation has remained weak over the last five years. Our second result is that Phillips curves are alive and well. When exploiting the cross-country variance of the data, wage inflation remains highly responsive to domestic unemployment rates, including after the Great Recession. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Exchange rates and market interest rates are closely related in emerging market economies (EMEs). A stronger currency goes hand in hand with lower market interest rates and generally looser financial conditions. A weaker currency is associated with higher market interest rates and tighter financial conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper lays out a framework where the exchange rate affects domestic market interest rates through the investment decisions of global investors, even when the market interest rates are those on bonds issued in domestic currency. In an empirical investigation of 14 EMEs, the analysis points to the shifts in market interest rates as arising from shifts in risk-taking attitude of investors.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>An appreciation of an EME currency against the US dollar compresses both the local currency and foreign currency sovereign bond spreads of the EME. Here, the relevant exchange rate is the bilateral US dollar exchange rate, not the trade-weighted effective exchange rate. Such compression in yield spreads is driven by the decrease in the credit risk premium. Also, an appreciation of EME currencies against the US dollar that is unrelated to the effective exchange rate significantly increases the EME domestic credit and output, while an isolated appreciation of the effective exchange rate has contractionary effects.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div>
  In emerging market economies, currency appreciation goes hand in hand with compressed sovereign bond spreads, even for local currency sovereign bonds. This yield compression comes from a reduction in the credit risk premium. Crucially, the relevant exchange rate involved in yield compression is the bilateral US dollar exchange rate, not the trade-weighted exchange rate. Our findings highlight endogenous co-movement of bond risk premia and exchange rates through the portfolio choice of global investors who evaluate returns in dollar terms.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When a central bank buys or sells foreign exchange, these market interventions not only influence the exchange rate, but also the lending by domestic banks to domestic borrowers. The reason for the additional impact on domestic credit comes about because borrowers' creditworthiness fluctuates with the value of the currency. When credit is judged to be growing too rapidly to maintain an even keel for the economy, intervention in the currency may therefore have a place in the monetary policy toolkit of the central bank.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a rarely available high-frequency central bank database of FX trades conducted by the Bank of the Republic, Colombia, and combine it with detailed bank-by-bank daily flow data on new loans to corporates covering the entire Colombian banking system. The data's high frequency, together with the panel structure of the entire credit registry, lets us make a rigorous study of how FX interventions might influence domestic bank lending. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to draw on such a database to study how financial stability might be affected by sterilised FX interventions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our findings lend support to the proposition that sterilised interventions, ie those accompanied by central bank monetary operations to keep interest rates unchanged, can help to slow credit growth at times when heavy capital inflows are driving up the domestic exchange rate. First, we find that sterilised FX purchases have a significant and persistent dampening effect on new domestic bank lending. Second, sterilised FX purchases weaken the domestic currency and reduce capital inflows. Third, central bank open market operations, even those unrelated to FX interventions, also reduce domestic lending. However, the estimated effect is much smaller than that of FX interventions. This highlights the importance of the exchange rate in transmitting the effects of an intervention to lending. Fourth, we find that sterilised FX purchases dampen lending growth more strongly at banks with weaker balance sheets.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div>
  We employ a unique central bank dataset of foreign exchange operations to study the impact of FX intervention on domestic credit. Using loan-level data in the credit registry, we find that sterilized purchases of dollars by the central bank dampen the flow of new domestic corporate loans. The impact is particularly strong for borrowers with larger currency mismatches and for banks with thinner capital buffers. Our analysis sheds light on the role of FX intervention as part of the macroprudential toolkit during credit booms associated with episodes of capital inflow surges.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study how firms in emerging market economies (EMEs) borrow and lend. We look at how firms exploit carry trades (eg when they can borrow in a low interest rate currency and lend in a high interest rate currency) and relate this to their borrowing activities and how they extend trade credit. We use a unique data set of non-financial firms in Mexico that includes detailed quarterly information on the currency and the structure of both assets and liabilities.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Non-financial firms provide a significant amount of financial resources to the economy, including trade credit. In EMEs, foreign currency credit plays an important role throughout the financial system. Cheaper foreign currency credit can lead firms to borrow in foreign currencies and build currency risk on their balance sheets. It can also affect real behaviour throughout the economy by impacting the extension of trade credit. Regulation and supervision often focus on banks and other financial firms. However, non-financial firms are much less regulated in the ways they borrow and lend, or take on currency risk.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Non-financial firms borrow in foreign currency and acquire short-term assets in both local and foreign currency. A large part of these assets consists of trade credit extended to their customers and other firms, as well as cash and financial investments. When the difference between the local and foreign currency interest rates increases, the short-term foreign currency exposure of these firms increases, as do their sales and the amount of trade credit extended and received. Firms that take on foreign currency risk through this process cut back on their investment after a sudden exchange rate shock, but their trade credit networks remain stable.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div>
  We use unique firm level data from Mexico to document that non-financial corporations engage in carry trades by borrowing in foreign currency and lending in domestic currency, largely to related partners (trade credit), accumulating currency risk in the process. The interest rate differential between local and foreign currency borrowing induces this behavior at a quarterly frequency, generating an expansion in foreign currency borrowing and FX mismatch, gross trade credit and sales. Firms that were active in carry-trades have comparatively decreased investment and profits following a large depreciation, but maintain their supply of trade credit.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Big sell-offs in financial markets ("risk-off shocks") can trigger severe recessions if fiscal and monetary policymakers fail to respond appropriately. After the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), central banks in advanced economies resorted to unconventional monetary tools such as asset purchases. These measures successfully propped up the economy, but they have also been criticised for encouraging investors to buy riskier assets ("reach-for-yield behaviour"). As such, they have been seen as a sort of free "put option" or insurance policy for investors.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We look at how financial markets around the world have reacted to risk-off shocks, and how the authorities have responded. First, we focus on how risk-off shocks have affected the financial markets of advanced economies, comparing their effects before and after the GFC. We then study the knock-on effects ("spillovers") from these shocks to emerging market economies (EMEs). We explore how these effects were influenced by the monetary policy of advanced economies, as well as the economic condition of EMEs. We pay particular attention to how the response of EMEs to these shocks has changed since the GFC.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the unconventional monetary policies of the main advanced economies were highly effective, at a time when already low interest rates would have hindered central banks from attempting to boost the economy through further policy rate cuts. Without these policies, financial markets would have been more vulnerable to global sell-offs. Most of the policy discussion has focused on the problems arising from the strong capital flows into EMEs that these policies encouraged. But we document a positive side to these policies. They increased the resilience of the rest of the world against global risk-off shocks. For EMEs in particular, this took the form of smaller credit spreads and a reduced tendency for long-term interest rates to rise sharply following such shocks.</p>

  Global risk-off shocks can be highly destabilizing for financial markets and, absent an adequate policy response, may trigger severe recessions. Policy responses were more complex for developed economies with very low interest rates after the GFC. We document, however, that the unconventional policies adopted by the main central banks were effective in containing asset price declines. These policies impacted long rates and inspired confidence in a policy-put framework that reduced the persistence of risk-off shocks. We also show that domestic macroeconomic and financial conditions play a key role in benefiting from the spillovers of these policies during risk-off episodes. Countries like Japan, which already had very low long rates, benefited less. However, Japan still benefited from the reduced persistence of risk-off shocks. In contrast, since one of the main channels through which emerging markets are historically affected by global risk-off shocks is through a sharp rise in long rates, the unconventional monetary policy phase has been relatively benign to emerging markets during these episodes, especially for those economies with solid macroeconomic fundamentals and deep domestic financial markets. We also show that unconventional monetary policy in the US had strong effects on long interest rates in most economies in the Asia-Pacific region (which helps during risk-off events but may be destabilizing otherwise -we do not take a stand on this tradeoff).

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper develops a model of endogenous bank funding-market conditions. A bank can attract more outside funding if it has more equity or offers the prospect of higher future profits. Banks consider equity costly and thus fund loans in part with outside funding. When bank loan losses reduce equity, then banks first increase outside funding. Where losses continue, bank funding conditions tighten and banks are forced to reduce outside funding. In such an event, banks are forced to decrease lending sharply and the economy experiences a financial crisis. I study banks' risk management and compare it with loan loss provisioning preferred by a regulator that internalises effects on bank future profits.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper highlights a fundamental inefficiency in economies with financial intermediation and presents novel implications for the cyclicality of bank capital regulation. So far, much attention has focused on inefficiently high bank risk-taking in the run-up to financial crises. In contrast, I focus on inefficiently <em>low</em> bank risk-taking <em>during</em> financial crises. The reason for the latter inefficiency is that a regulator can mitigate the risk of binding bank funding conditions by increasing a bank's future profits to offset decreases in bank equity.<strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The first main policy implication is that banks should build up capital buffers during normal times. The idea is to make banks more resilient to loan losses as a way of reducing ex ante the severity of financial crises and of lowering their frequency. Intuitively, a small reduction in loan supply during normal times - because of costly capital buffers - is traded off against a large reduction during times of financial crisis.</p>
<p>The second main policy implication is that banks should be given ample time to rebuild capital buffers following a financial crisis and that regulation should increase bank profitability in that process. The idea is to raise the prospect of future profitability during the financial crisis with a view to increasing a bank's access to outside funding and reducing ex post the severity of a financial crisis. Intuitively, a small reduction in loan supply during the recovery - because of temporarily elevated bank profit margins - is traded off against a large reduction during the financial crisis.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div>
  This paper studies optimal bank capital requirements in a model of endogenous bank funding conditions. I find that requirements should be higher during good times such that a macroprudential "buffer" is provided. However, whether banks can use buffers to maintain lending during a financial crisis depends on the capital requirement during the subsequent recovery. The reason is that a high requirement during the recovery lowers bank shareholder value during the crisis and thus creates funding-market pressure to use buffers for deleveraging rather than for maintaining lending. Therefore, buffers are useful if banks are not required to rebuild them quickly.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>One of the laws of economics states that central banks in countries with flexible exchange rates and open capital accounts should be able to ensure macroeconomic stability regardless of external financing conditions. But central banks in emerging market economies (EMEs) hold a different view. They express strong concerns about the damaging effects of volatile capital flows. Some perceive the constraint as increasing their policy rates whenever financial market volatility or US policy rates increase.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper adds to the debate on whether EMEs can have both monetary independence and open capital accounts. This issue came to the fore following the large swings in capital flows experienced during the financial crisis and amid concerns about spillovers from US monetary tightening. We provide a theory that rationalises how capital flows can hinder monetary policy independence, even when exchange rates are flexible. </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that when external debt is large, the monetary independence of an EME central bank can be limited. When interest rate cuts reduce capital inflows - for example, because carry traders unwind their positions or owing to currency mismatches - the central bank may be constrained by an "expansionary lower bound" (ELB). Below this ELB threshold, monetary easing triggers capital outflows that tighten domestic credit and drag economic activity down. This amounts to a lower bound on EME interest rates that can materialise even for positive interest rates. Global financial conditions affect the ELB and thus the central bank's ability to support the economy. Tightening global financial conditions raise the ELB and can force monetary authorities to increase policy rates, thereby pushing their economies into recession. Our theory has profound policy implications. It suggests that policymakers should limit the build-up of debt by running the economy below potential when global financial conditions are supportive. It also backs the case for alternative policy tools that can be used to regain monetary space, especially unconventional monetary policies, capital controls and macroprudential measures.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div>
  We provide a theory of the limits to monetary policy independence in open economies arising from the interaction between capital flows and domestic collateral constraints. The key feature is the existence of an "Expansionary Lower Bound" (ELB), defined as an interest rate threshold below which monetary easing becomes contractionary. The ELB can be positive, thus binding before the ZLB. Furthermore, the ELB is affected by global monetary and financial conditions, leading to novel international spillovers and crucial departures from Mundell's trilemma. We present two models in which the ELB may arise due to either carry-trade capital flows or currency mismatches.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This working paper reassures managers of US dollar reserves at central banks that they need not worry about a shortage of safe assets. This runs counter to the argument that a shortage of safe assets is key to understanding international finance. In that thesis, emerging market economies (EMEs) need to accumulate such assets in line with their own growth. But if advanced economy governments were to issue debt on a scale likely to meet this demand, they risk becoming over-indebted and losing their creditworthiness. Such a hypothetical shortage of safe assets could make managing foreign exchange reserves very difficult. After all, official reserve managers focus on safe assets. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The working paper constructs the global portfolio of dollar foreign exchange reserves, drawing on three sources. A US Treasury and Federal Reserve annual survey gives holdings of securities and bank deposits in the United States. Then BIS international banking data show holdings of eurodollar bank deposits (mostly repurchase agreements). Finally, a novel estimate of official holdings of offshore bonds comes from indices of US dollar bonds of AAA- and AA-rated sovereigns, subsovereigns, supranationals, and non-US agencies, along with information on the official bid in the primary market.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>This portfolio suggests that the safe assets story relies on very restrictive assumptions. On the demand side, EMEs evidently do not need to add to their holdings of safe assets in line with output growth. Indeed, the world may have reached "peak reserves" in 2014. On the supply side, US agencies and banks compete with the US Treasury, even though they depend on government support in adversity. The US Treasury also faces competition from abroad: creditworthy banks, sovereigns, subsovereigns, supranationals and foreign agencies. All in all, dollar reserve managers have invested a third of their fixed income portfolio in instruments other than US Treasury securities.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Official reserve managers have a big stake in the debate over safe assets: their portfolios just about define such assets. This paper conveys the message that reserve managers need not worry about a shortage of safe assets. The debate turns first on whether demand for dollar safe assets will grow as rapidly as emerging market economies (EMEs). Second, it turns on whether the supply of dollar safe assets only grows with US fiscal deficits. Neither holds. On the demand side, EMEs' growth does not require ever higher dollar reserves. Indeed, the global economy may have reached "peak reserves" in 2014. On the supply side, law and policy extend state backing to various IOUs, thereby creating safe assets. US government support for the housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has made their debt into safe assets, albeit with wobbles. Federal Reserve liquidity, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance, and, in extremis as in 2008, Treasury equity also work to make US bank deposits safe. Elsewhere, government support of banks allows those from well rated countries to compete with US banks in issuing safe dollar deposits. Moreover, supranational organisations, non-US sovereigns and their agencies all compete with the US Treasury in issuing safe dollar bonds. In allocating their dollar foreign exchange reserves, central banks make room for such competitors. In particular, they hold more than a third of such reserves in instruments other than US Treasury securities.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies how securities lending affects over-the-counter market (OTC) liquidity.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The financial crisis of 2007-09 kindled a wider interest in studies of liquidity in OTC financial markets, such as the corporate bond market. Buyers and sellers in these markets trade without centralised exchanges. The greater time and resources needed to complete trades can impede market liquidity - the ability to transact efficiently. Intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, may emerge to maintain an inventory of securities and to match buyers and sellers. Securities lending markets offer dealers a way to mitigate the consequences of frictions inherent in OTC markets. We identify and quantify the importance of securities lending of corporate bonds to market liquidity in the OTC corporate bond market.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We combine data on corporate bond market trades with data on corporate bond lending transactions and data on the individual corporate bond holdings of US insurance companies. Our empirical design carefully controls for the many confounding determinants of market liquidity. We show that the shutdown of AIG's securities lending programme in 2008 caused a reduction in the market liquidity of corporate bonds held predominantly by AIG. We also provide evidence for an important mechanism behind the decrease in corporate bond liquidity: Dealers used the inter-dealer market as an imperfect substitute for the securities lending market. In particular, we document a shift towards relatively small trades with other dealers in the inter-dealer market.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies how over-the-counter market liquidity is affected by securities lending. We combine micro-data on corporate bond market trades with securities lending transactions and individual corporate bond holdings by U.S. insurance companies. Applying a difference-in-differences empirical strategy, we show that the shutdown of AIG's securities lending program in 2008 caused a statistically and economically significant reduction in the market liquidity of corporate bonds predominantly held by AIG. We also show that an important mechanism behind the decrease in corporate bond liquidity was a shift towards relatively small trades among a greater number of dealers in the interdealer market.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper investigates for-profit central counterparties (CCPs), asking whether their incentives might undermine financial stability. Such CCPs choose how much capital to hold, and set the collateral requirement for their clearing members, so as to maximise their own profits. They face a trade-off between fee income and counterparty credit risk. But a CCP's limited liability creates a misalignment between its choices and the socially optimal solution to this trade-off. In studying the factors that give rise to this misalignment, the paper derives the optimal capital regulations and examines the significant role of CCP ownership structures in safeguarding financial stability.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>From a theoretical viewpoint, this is the first paper in the literature to argue that a for-profit CCP would seek to hold less capital than is optimal from a social welfare perspective and, similarly, would require less collateral from its members than is optimal, thus undermining financial stability. From an empirical angle, this paper also provides the first evidence of a relationship between the capital held by CCPs and the collateral they require.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The model developed in this paper implies that better-capitalised CCPs set higher collateral requirements. Empirical evidence suggests that a 1% increase in a for-profit CCP's capital is associated with a 0.6% increase in its members' collateral. </p>
<p>Another implication, again deriving from its capitalisation and collateral choices, is that a for-profit CCP is more likely to fail than is socially optimal. By contrast, a user-owned CCP chooses to hold more capital and is therefore less likely to fail. Indeed, the data show that user-owned CCPs hold significantly more capital, on average, than for-profit CCPs do. </p>
<p>Optimal capital requirements are derived for different levels of the clearing fees charged by for-profit CCPs. When this fee is low, the capital requirements incentivise CCPs to demand more collateral, thus bolstering financial stability. When fees are high, capital requirements do not change a CCP's incentives but serve to boost its loss-absorbing capacity.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Financial stability depends on the effective regulation of central counterparties (CCPs), which must take account of the incentives that drive CCP behavior. This paper studies the incentives of a for-profit CCP with limited liability. It faces a trade-off between fee income and counterparty credit risk. A better-capitalized CCP sets a higher collateral requirement to reduce potential default losses, even though it forgoes fee income by deterring potential traders. I show empirically that a 1% increase in CCP capital is associated with a 0.6% increase in required collateral. Limited liability, however, creates a wedge between its capital and collateral policy and the socially optimal solution to this trade-off. The optimal capital requirements should account for clearing fees.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We address to what extent a central bank can de-risk its balance sheet through unconventional monetary policy operations. To that end, we propose a novel risk measurement framework to empirically study the time variation in central bank portfolio credit risks associated with such operations.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>For at least 150 years, going back to early contributions such as Thornton (1802) and Bagehot (1873), central bankers have wondered to what extent they make rather than take their own balance sheet risks during turbulent times. Theoretically, the possibility of the central bank influencing its own risk is uncontroversial. In the context of a pure illiquidity crisis without solvency concerns, for example, the simple offer by the central bank to act as a lender of last resort to the entire financial system in line with Bagehot-inspired principles could shift the economy from a "bad" to a "good" equilibrium, causing all illiquidity-related credit risks to quickly disappear at virtually no cost or additional central bank balance sheet risk. We study whether such a possibility is wishful thinking or empirically relevant.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We focus on three main findings. First, we find that lender of last resort- and investor of last resort-implied credit risks were usually negatively related in Eurosystem data between 2009 and 2015. Taking risk in one part of the central bank's balance sheet tended to de-risk other positions. This negative relationship implies that, overall, central bank risks can be non-linear in exposures. Second, some unconventional policy operations did not add risk to the Eurosystem's balance sheet in net terms, in line with Bagehot's well known assertion that, in some situations, "only the brave plan is the safe plan". Finally, our risk estimates suggest that the Eurosystem's unconventional monetary policies differed in terms of ex post "risk efficiency".</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We address to what extent a central bank can de-risk its balance sheet by unconventional monetary policy operations. To that end, we propose a novel risk measurement framework to empirically study the time variation in central bank portfolio credit risks associated with such operations. The framework accommodates a large number of bank and sovereign counterparties, joint tail dependence, skewness, and time-varying dependence parameters. In an application to selected items from the consolidated Eurosystem's weekly balance sheet between 2009 and 2015, we find that unconventional monetary policy operations generated beneficial risk spillovers across monetary policy operations, causing overall risk to be non-linear in exposures. Some policy operations reduced rather than increased overall risk.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper focuses on how Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies verify that payments are final, ie irreversible once written into the blockchain. It points to the high costs of achieving such finality via "proof-of-work". It then weighs the outlook for cryptocurrencies based on this kind of algorithm, and looks at possible future avenues for progress.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper shows that two economic limitations affect the outlook of cryptocurrencies modelled on proof-of-work. The first lies in the extreme costs of ensuring payment finality in a reasonable space of time. The second is that these systems will not be able to generate transaction fees that are adequate to guarantee payment security in future. The paper shows that the future of Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies is crucially affected by the interplay of these two limitations.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>After surveying the market for transactions and the way fees are determined, the paper finds that the liquidity of cryptocurrencies is set to shrink. In this light, the paper then asks how technical progress might raise the efficiency of Bitcoin-type payments. So-called second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network could help. Or methods other than proof-of-work could be used to achieve payment finality. But these might require coordination mechanisms, implying support from a central institution. Thus, the current technology seems unlikely to replace the current monetary and financial infrastructure. Instead, the question is rather how the technology might complement existing arrangements.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper discusses the economics of how Bitcoin achieves data immutability, and thus payment finality, via costly computations, ie "proof-of-work". Further, it explores what the future might hold for cryptocurrencies modelled on this type of consensus algorithm. The conclusions are, first, that Bitcoin counterfeiting via "double-spending" attacks is inherently profitable, making payment finality based on proof-of-work extremely expensive. Second, the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of "mining" income via fees as users free-ride on the fees of other transactions in a block and in the subsequent blockchain. Instead, newly minted bitcoins, known as block rewards, have made up the bulk of mining income to date. Looking ahead, these two limitations imply that liquidity is set to fall dramatically as these block rewards are phased out. Simple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero, it could take months before a Bitcoin payment is final, unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality. Second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network might help, but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work, which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalisation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>There is growing evidence that international financial spillovers have become a two-way street. They occur not only from the major advanced economies to the rest of the world, but also, and increasingly, from a group of large middle-income countries to advanced economies. Because financial markets are prone to amplification effects, and because business and financial cycles remain imperfectly synchronised across countries, this new environment creates the potential for shocks in one jurisdiction to be magnified and transmitted to others through short-term capital flows. In turn, these flows may exacerbate financial instability in both originating and recipient countries, thereby creating a case for international macroprudential policy coordination. The paper's objective is to characterize the cross-border transmission mechanism of global financial shocks and measure the gains from such coordination.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper develops a two-region, core-periphery model with imperfect financial integration and cross-border banking to study the transmission of financial shocks and the gains from international macroprudential policy coordination.  The model is calibrated for two groups of countries, the major advanced economies and a group of large (systemically important) middle-income countries, which have been identified in recent studies as generating significant reverse spillovers (or spillbacks) to advanced economies. Financial frictions occur at two levels: between firms and banks in each region, and between periphery banks and a global bank in the core.  </p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Numerical experiments show that the model replicates the stylized facts associated with global banking shocks, with respect to output, credit, house prices, and real exchange rate fluctuations in recipient countries, as documented in the empirical literature. Welfare gains from macroprudential policy coordination are positive---and significant, provided that the cost of instrument manipulation is not too large---if the degree of international financial integration, which raises the scope for spillback effects from the periphery to the core, is sufficiently high. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper discusses the properties of a well functioning monetary system, in both its day-to-day operation and the longer run. It defines a monetary system as money plus the mechanisms for the execution of payments. It draws on theory, history and practical experience.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper provides a framework to paint a coherent picture of a broad set of issues typically analysed separately in economics. The framework covers money, payments, monetary operations, cryptocurrencies, money neutrality, free banking, inflation and the relationship between monetary and financial stability. The paper highlights the role of trust-building institutions, notably central banks. It draws on the lessons of the history of money, credit, banks and central banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Treating the issues separately obscures important relationships. Trust is the foundation of a well functioning monetary system. The distinction between money and credit, both underpinned by trust, is overdone. A demand-determined, elastic supply of credit is essential for the system to operate at all and to set interest rates. But in the longer run, too elastic a supply can undermine monetary and financial stability. The notion that the monetary base, rather than the interest rate, is the system's ultimate anchor is incorrect. For similar reasons, the same is true of the common view that changes in the monetary base drive the supply of money. As concepts, monetary and financial stability are joined at the hip, but the processes underlying them are quite different. As regards price stability, it is not appropriate to think of the price level as the inverse of the price of money. The common view that, in the long run, money affects only prices is highly suspect. When inflation is low, thinking of it as distinct from relative price changes muddies the waters. As regards financial stability, the focus should be on the forces that generate financial booms and busts. Ensuring lasting monetary and financial stability is the main challenge ahead. The current monetary system, with prudential regulation and central banks at its core, is not perfect and must be improved. But it provides the best basis on which to build further. Cryptocurrencies are not a viable alternative.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This essay examines in detail the properties of a well functioning monetary system - defined as money plus the mechanisms to execute payments - in both the short and long run, drawing on both theory and the lessons from history. It stresses the importance of trust and of the institutions needed to secure it. Ensuring price and financial stability is critical to nurturing and maintaining that trust. In the process, the essay addresses several related questions, such as the relationship between money and debt, the viability of cryptocurrencies as money, money neutrality, and the nexus between monetary and financial stability. While the present monetary system, with central banks and a prudential apparatus at its core, can and must be improved, it still provides the best basis to build on.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This working paper contributes to a growing body of work that breaks free of the "triple coincidence" often assumed in international finance. A currency's domain does not coincide with the borders of the jurisdiction that issues it. Instead, key currencies enjoy global use. A key currency perspective can change how global imbalances look to economists, policymakers and market participants.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We take a step forward in the analysis of key currencies in international finance. Researchers have sorted currencies into groups around key currencies, principally the dollar and the euro. We investigate the macroeconomic consequences of such groupings. In particular, we measure the current accounts and international investment positions of key currency zones. International investment and borrowing shows a zone bias.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Economies whose currencies vary less against the dollar than against any other key currency - the dollar zone - make up over half of the global economy. Over time, the geographical reach of the similarly defined euro (or, earlier, the Deutsche mark) zone has substantially extended beyond northwestern Europe. Yet the global share of the dollar zone has remained remarkably stable. Faster growth in hitherto dollar-centred Asia outside Japan resolves this seeming paradox.</p>
<p>The current account balance of the dollar zone has followed a very different path from that of the United States over the last 20 years. In particular, it approached balance in the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09. The wide US current account deficit had led many economists to warn of an impending dollar crisis. An idea of the dollar zone's current account would have made the dollar's sharp appreciation in 2008 less surprising.</p>

</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This study divides the world into currency zones according to the co-movement of each currency with the key currencies. The dollar zone groups economies that produce well over half of global GDP. The euro zone now includes almost all of Europe and some commodity producers, but remains less than half the size of the dollar zone. The dollar zone share has shown striking stability despite big shifts across zones over time. These include the demise of the sterling zone and the expansion of the DM/euro from northwestern Europe to Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Global imbalances differ from a currency perspective. In the 2000s, the dollar zone's current account disappeared by the onset of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), even as the US current account plumbed all-time lows. The dollar zone's net international investment position also reached balance then. Thus, neither flow nor stock readings on the dollar zone supported widespread predictions in the early 2000s of an imminent dollar crash. In fact, most of the long-term widening of current accounts occurred within currency zones, where by construction currency risk is limited.</p>
<p>Our account of the dollar's dominance rests not on the US economy's size but rather on the size of the dollar zone. In such a world, the rise of another large economy poses the question not of relative size but rather of re-alignment of third currencies. What if the renminbi becomes a key currency alongside the dollar and the euro? Already some emerging market currencies are co-moving with the renminbi against the dollar. On current evidence, a renminbi zone would shrink the dollar zone, and widen its current account deficit.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We propose a new approach to categorising the information contained in various forms of central bank communication (such as monetary policy decision statements, press conferences and minutes). Looking at how bond yields and equity returns move together in response to central bank announcements, we infer different types of underlying economic shocks. We classify this information content in terms of surprises related to monetary policy, the economic growth outlook, and shifts in risk premia. </p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Building on a macro-finance model of asset prices, we obtain predictions of how different economic shocks influence the direction of the co-movement between stocks and yields and its strength along the yield curve. A conventional monetary shock affects the real interest rate, causing equity prices and bond yields to move in opposite directions, this effect being stronger at short maturities. Shocks to both growth expectations and risk premia cause equity prices and bond yields to move in the same direction. To discriminate between these two types of shock, we exploit the fact that their effects differ in the yield maturity dimension. Growth shocks have a greater effect on the short-to-intermediate part of the yield curve, whereas risk premium shocks more strongly affect its long segment.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that news about economic activity and shocks to risk premia (ie non-monetary news) accounts for more than half of the communication events at four major central banks (the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Fed and ECB). We find significant differences in the news composition across communication tools and over time. Monetary news prevails in the announcements of monetary policy decisions. In press conferences, however, news about economic growth is the dominant piece of information gleaned by market participants. The same is true of other forms of communication aimed at explaining the context of policy decisions. Risk premium shocks typically generate more abrupt movements in asset prices, and their prominence has increased as central banks have resorted to unconventional monetary policies. We find a break in communication content whereby non-monetary news dominated communication during the financial crisis and in its immediate aftermath, with monetary news gaining in importance starting from mid-2013 onward.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We quantify the importance of non-monetary news in central bank communication. Using evidence from four major central banks and a comprehensive classification of events, we decompose news conveyed by central banks into news about monetary policy, economic growth, and separately, shocks to risk premia. Our approach exploits high-frequency comovement of stocks and interest rates combined with monotonicity restrictions across the yield curve. We find significant differences in news composition depending on the communication channel used by central banks. Non-monetary news prevails in about 40% of policy decision announcements by the Fed and the ECB, and this fraction is even higher for communications that provide context to policy decisions such as press conferences. We show that non-monetary news accounts for a significant part of financial markets' reaction during the financial crisis and in the early recovery, while monetary shocks gain importance since 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Update - March 2022: Dataset of international capital flows by sector</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="/publ/work760_dataset.xlsx">data set</a> contains quarterly series of international capital flows for 85 countries between Q1 1996 and Q4 2020, broken down by sector of the domestic economy.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>International capital flows can have a significant impact on macroeconomic outcomes. Thus, understanding their properties and drivers is of crucial importance. A number of studies have examined aggregate capital flows from various angles. Yet, the existing literature on gross capital flows has largely ignored their sectoral composition. This important gap is due mainly to the scarcity of data on gross capital flows, broken down by sector.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We construct a new data set, in which we break down gross capital flows by sector (banks, corporates and sovereigns). To maximise coverage, we combine data from the Balance of Payments with other data sources, such as the BIS international banking statistics and the BIS international debt securities statistics. Our data set provides information on both capital inflows (85 countries from Q1 1996 to Q4 2014) and outflows (31 countries from Q1 2004 to Q4 2014) at a quarterly frequency. We focus mainly on debt flows. Using this data set, we show that the properties and drivers of capital flows vary considerably across sectors, instruments and country groups.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We document four new empirical facts. First, banks in advanced economies are responsible for the high correlation between capital inflows and outflows. Second, the private sector is the main driver of the procyclicality of capital inflows. By contrast, inflows to emerging market sovereigns move countercyclically. Third, advanced economy banks and emerging market sovereigns drive the procyclicality of capital outflows. Fourth, when global risk aversion is high, private sector flows decline, while sovereign flows show no significant response.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We construct a new data set of quarterly international capital flows by sector, with an emphasis on debt flows. Using our new data set, we establish four facts. First, the co-movement of capital inflows and outflows is driven by inflows and outflows vis-à-vis the domestic banking sector. Second, the procyclicality of capital inflows is driven by banks and corporates, whereas sovereigns' external liabilities move acyclically in advanced and countercyclically in emerging countries. Third, the procyclicality of capital outflows is driven by advanced countries' banks and emerging countries' sovereigns (reserves). Fourth, capital inflows and outflows decline for banks and corporates when global risk aversion (VIX) increases, whereas sovereign flows show no response. These facts are inconsistent with a large class of theoretical models.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The more inflation expectations are anchored, the less sensitive inflation will be to economic shocks. But the degree of anchoring may vary between different types of agents. The anchoring of businesses who set prices and, together with trade unions, negotiate wages may be most important for explaining how inflation behaves. But most studies focus on the anchoring of analysts instead, because their forecasts are more readily available.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use surveys of inflation forecasts for three different types of agents: analysts, businesses and trade unions. We focus on South Africa, one of the few countries for which such data is available. We then assess how well inflation is anchored for each of the types of agents. We define the inflation anchor as the expected level of inflation if there were no shocks to the economy. We model inflation forecasts as increasingly diverging from recent actual inflation towards the anchor the further into the future the forecasts look.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the estimated inflation anchors of analysts are within the inflation target range of the central bank. However, those for businesses and trade unions, which are likely to be the most important for explaining inflation outcomes, are above the top end of the target range. Our results point to challenges for central banks seeking to gain credibility with agents whose decisions directly influence inflation.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Forecasts of agents who are actively involved in the setting of prices and wages are less readily available than those of professional analysts, but may be more relevant for understanding inflation dynamics. Here we compare inflation expectations anchoring between analysts, businesses and trade unions for one country for which comparable forecasts are available for almost two decades: South Africa. Forecasts are modelled as monotonically diverging from an estimated long-run anchor point, or "implicit anchor", towards actual inflation as the forecast horizon shortens. We find that the estimated inflation anchors of analysts lie within the 3-6 percent inflation target range of the central bank. However, those for businesses and trade unions, which our evidence suggests may be most relevant for driving the inflation process, have remained above the top end of the official target range. Our results point to challenges for central banks seeking to gain credibility with agents whose decisions directly influence inflation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>A negative shock to a firm's balance sheet can impair the firm's borrowing and investment. Especially in emerging market economies, firms are vulnerable to such shocks through a currency depreciation when they borrow in foreign currency. This paper studies such balance sheet effects using a unique data set of firms in Mexico. The data include detailed information on loans from each bank and the foreign currency on firms' balance sheets, and cover a period with a large depreciation.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Firm balance sheet effects may play a large role in generating or amplifying financial stress. However, effects can occur at the same time as negative shocks occur to bank lending or to demand from firms. This makes it difficult to tell if a change in firms' outcomes is due to the balance sheet shock or other factors. Using the information on how much each firm borrows from each bank, the paper isolates changes in borrowing and investment due to firms' balance sheet shocks from those changes arising from how much the banks lend generally as well as from other potential factors.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Balance sheet effects do affect a firm's borrowing and investment. Firms undergoing a negative shock due to a currency depreciation experience a decrease in their borrowing in foreign currency. Larger firms, however, are able to replace the lost funding by borrowing in their domestic currency, whereas smaller firms cannot. These differences affect real activity: larger firms are able to increase investment and employment following a depreciation, while smaller firms decrease their investment.</p>
<p>These results imply that the health of the firm's balance sheet constrains its ability to borrow. This constraint is tighter for foreign currency borrowing and looser for larger firms.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Emerging market firms frequently borrow in foreign currency (FX), but their assets are often denominated in domestic currency. This behavior leads to an FX mismatch on firms balance sheets, which can harm their net worth in the event of a depreciation. I use a large, unanticipated, and exogenous depreciation episode and a unique dataset to identify the real and financial effects of firm balance sheet shocks. I construct a new dataset of all listed non-financial firms, matched to their banks, in Mexico over 2008q1-2015q2. This dataset combines firm-level balance sheets and real outcomes, currency composition of both assets and liabilities, and firms' loan-level borrowing from banks in peso and FX. This data allows me to control for shocks to firms' credit supply to identify the balance sheet shock and examine its real consequences. I find that non-exporting firms that have a larger FX mismatch experience greater negative balance sheet effects following the depreciation. Among these, smaller firms see a decrease in loan growth, resulting in stagnant employment growth and decreased growth in physical capital relative to firms with smaller FX mismatch. Larger firms with a large FX mismatch also have lower growth in FX loans following the shock, but are able to increase borrowing in peso loans, resulting in relatively higher growth in employment and physical capital. My results imply that firms are subject to net worth based borrowing constraints, and that these constraints are more binding on smaller firms and for loans in FX.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the strength and characteristics of interest rate spillovers from seven advanced economy central banks to 47 advanced and emerging market economies. Our main focus is on the channels through which spillovers occur and why some countries respond more than others to changes in monetary policy in advanced economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Interest rate co-movement is well documented, but existing work often struggles to identify whether it stems from spillovers or from common drivers. We improve on this by using cleanly identified high-frequency monetary policy surprises (including target, path and term premia shocks) to better pin down the direction and size of spillovers. </p>
<p>We also test through which channels spillovers occur: (i) economic conditions, (ii) the exchange rate regime, or (iii) the impact of bond risk premia. We use a data set that encompasses bilateral and aggregate economic and financial links as well country-specific factors to explore the conditions that lead to stronger (or weaker) spillovers.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find strong spillovers originating from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Spillovers from other advanced economy central banks (including the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan) are mild. Spillovers are more much prevalent for long-term interest rates, while short rates do not consistently respond to foreign monetary policy news. These effects tend to be larger for advanced economies, which are well integrated in global capital markets, than they are for emerging market economies. </p>
<p>We get a clear picture of the factors behind different spillover intensities across countries. There is no support for a channel operating through macroeconomic interlinkages, and partial support for an exchange rate regime channel. In support of a channel operating through risk premia, we find that financial openness is the strongest factor in explaining the strength of spillovers across countries.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using monetary policy shocks for seven advanced economy central banks, measured at high-frequency, we document the strength and characteristics of interest rate spillovers to 47 advanced and emerging market economies. Our main goal is to assess different channels through which spillovers occur and why some countries' interest rates respond more than others. We find that there is no evidence that spillovers relate to real linkages, such as trade flows. There is some indication that exchange rate regimes influence the extent of spillovers. By far the strongest determinant of interest rate spillovers is financial openness. Countries that have stronger bilateral (and aggregate) financial links with the US or euro area are susceptible to stronger interest rate spillovers. These effects are much more pronounced at the longer end of the yield curve, indicating that while countries retain policy rate independence, financial conditions are influenced by global yields.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper investigates the link between an economy's financial structure (that is, the mix of bank- vs market-provided funds) and income inequality.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Using data for 97 advanced and emerging market economies over 1989-2012, we try to answer four questions: Does financial development affect inequality? Does the financial structure (the mix of bank- and market-provided funds) change the relationship between finance and inequality? Is the relationship non-linear (with sign change at a certain threshold)? And does any non-linearity differ for bank-provided finance and market-provided finance?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results show that the relationship between financial development and income inequality is not linear. Up to a point, more finance reduces income inequality. Beyond that point, inequality rises if finance is expanded through market-based financing, but not when finance grows via bank lending. These findings agree with a well established literature indicating that deeper financial systems help reduce poverty and inequality in developing countries, but also with recent evidence of rising inequality in some financially advanced economies.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper empirically investigates the link between financial structure and income inequality. Using data for a panel of 97 economies over the period 1989-2012, we find that the relationship is not monotonic. Up to a point, more finance reduces income inequality. Beyond that point, inequality rises if finance is expanded via market-based financing, while it does not when finance grows via bank lending. These findings concur with a well-established literature indicating that deeper financial systems help reduce poverty and inequality in developing countries, but also with recent evidence of rising inequality in various financially advanced economies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Even though the Great Financial Crisis sparked interest in financial cycles, researchers and policymakers have yet to forge a workhorse model. One reason is the disagreement about key factors leading to the crisis. While some argue it resulted from a unique set of developments that exposed weaknesses in the financial regulatory system, others point to broad similarities across past boom-bust experiences. They infer from these similarities that cycles are an inherent feature of financially liberalised economies. We look at broad historical swings in financial cycles to weigh up these views.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper adds a new perspective to the literature on empirical financial cycles. It highlights the recurring and inherent nature of swings in financial conditions, which result in costly booms and busts. However, this characterisation does not appear so obvious when looking at conventionally plotted historical data (that is, observed in calendar time). We shed light on the facts by distinguishing between financial cycles in calendar time and in what we call "financial cycle time".</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Extending the methods pioneered by James Stock (1987) in his study of business cycles, we find that historical swings in the financial cycle exhibit statistical time deformation, which is time-varying. Changes in this gap between calendar time and financial cycle time are strongly associated with time-varying macrofinancial risk perceptions. Key risk indicators include the long-term real interest rate, inflation volatility and corporate credit spreads. The implications for statistical modelling, endogenous risk-taking economic behaviour and policy are highlighted. This evidence supports the view that financial cycles are a recurrent and inherent feature of the financial system, strengthening the case for macroprudential and monetary policies that lean against the wind.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Motivated by the traditional business cycle approach of Burns and Mitchell (1946), we explore cyclical similarities in financial conditions over time in order to improve our understanding of financial cycles. Looking back at 120 years of data, we find that financial cycles exhibit behaviour characterised by recurrent, endogenous swings in financial conditions, which result in costly booms and busts. Yet the recurrent nature of such swings may not appear so obvious when looking at conventionally plotted time-series data (that is, observed in calendar time). Using the pioneering framework developed by Stock (1987), we offer a new statistical characterisation of the financial cycle using a continuous-time autoregressive model subject to time deformation, and test for systematic differences between calendar and a new notion of financial cycle time. We find the time deformation to be statistically significant, and associated with levels of long-term real interest rates, inflation volatility and the perceived riskiness of the macro-financial environment. Implications for statistical modelling, endogenous risk-taking economic behaviour and policy are highlighted.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The ECB has deployed a broad array of unconventional monetary policy tools over the last few years. Those include negative interest rates, and several programmes of asset purchases and long-term liquidity provision, which we bundle together under the general label of "quantitative easing". We study the impact of these measures on the "resilience" of banks in the euro area. We characterise the bank level resilience in terms of the size of a shock to profitability, as measured by returns on assets, which a bank can withstand without wiping out its loss-absorbing buffers.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Unconventional monetary policy tools have the purpose of supporting the economy and providing further stimulus at times when the effectiveness of conventional tools appears exhausted, in particular when the policy interest rate is reaching the zero-lower bound (ZLB). There is a lively debate about the role that unconventional tools have had, and what would that role be in future policymaking. That debate encloses, in part, an assessment of the actual costs and benefits of these tools. This paper contributes to that debate by shedding light on the effect that unconventional tools have on bank resilience, and thereby on financial stability. This is admittedly a side effect of these tools but a full cost-benefit analysis should not ignore this kind of effect. In this paper, we primarily address this issue using balance sheet data for a large sample of euro area banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Overall our results suggest that, away from the ZLB, lower interest rates tend to weaken banks' loss absorbing buffers. However we show that, as interest rates approach the ZLB or turn negative, further reductions actually enhance buffers, as a result of non-linearities around the ZLB. Quantitative easing would strengthen bank buffers overall, supporting the financial stability of the euro area. These findings expose the underlying complexities when it comes to disentangle the effects of monetary policy tools in the euro area. We also report that the benefits of improved resilience would have accrued mostly to banks headquartered in the core of the euro area. Banks based on the member states hardest hit by the 2011 sovereign debt crisis appeared to become less resilient as a result of these policies during our sample period.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper examines whether euro area unconventional monetary policies have affected the loss-absorbing buffers (that is the resilience) of the banking industry. We employ various measures to capture the effect of the broad array of programmes used by the ECB to implement balance sheet policies, while we control for the effect of conventional and negative (or very low) interest rate policy. The results suggest that, above and away from the zero-lower bound, looser interest rate policy tends to weaken our measure of euro area banks' loss-absorbing buffers. On the contrary, further lowering interest rates near and below the zero lower bound seems to strengthen (or weaken less) such buffers, which points towards non-linearities arising in the vicinity of the lower bound. Moreover, balance sheet easing policies enhance bank level resilience overall. However, unconventional monetary policies seem to have increased the fragility of banks in the member states hardest hit by the 2011 sovereign debt crisis. In fact, the evidence presented in this paper suggest that the resilience gains of unconventional monetary policies have accrued mostly to banks headquartered in the so-called core euro area countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands). Finally, unconventional monetary policies seem to have enhanced more the resilience of banks that were relatively stronger, i.e. that were in the higher deciles of the distribution of loss-absorbing buffers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Emerging market firms that borrow in US dollars but accumulate cash in domestic currency are vulnerable to a depreciation of the domestic currency against the dollar.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper looks back at the period of emerging market stress between mid-2014 and early 2016. Combining detailed firm balance sheet data and market variables for individual companies, the paper identifies "carry trade" activities of non-financial firms in emerging market economies (EMEs) - where they finance cash in local currency with the proceeds of dollar borrowing - as a source of vulnerability when the local currency depreciates against the dollar.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>There are three major findings. First, firms with larger increases in cash holdings up to 2015 suffer larger declines in stock prices during subsequent periods of currency depreciation. This negative impact on stock prices is largest for firms that had borrowed in dollars. </p>
<p>Second, the vulnerability to currency depreciation comes not from foreign currency debt as such, but from the combination of foreign currency debt and the holding of cash and liquid assets in domestic currency. In other words, the adverse impact of currency depreciation arises not solely from the liabilities side of the firm's balance sheet, but in combination with the asset side. </p>
<p>Third, higher cash holdings go hand in hand with higher dollar bond issuance. </p>
<p>Taken together, the findings support the hypothesis that EME firms took advantage of favourable funding conditions to accumulate financial assets in domestic currency by issuing dollar debt. In effect, they were engaged in a carry trade funded with dollars, leaving them vulnerable to risk of loss when the dollar strengthened.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>How do emerging market corporates fare during periods of currency depreciation? We find that non-financial firms that exploit favorable global financing conditions to issue US dollar bonds and build cash balances are also those whose share price is most vulnerable to local currency depreciation. In particular, firms' vulnerability to currency depreciation derives less from the foreign currency debt as such, but from the cash balances that are built up by using foreign currency debt. Overall, our results point to a financial motive for dollar bond issuance by emerging market firms in carry trade-like transactions that leave them vulnerable in an environment of dollar strength.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies how prudential regulation, financial development and financial openness can affect economic growth. It adopts both a theoretical and an empirical perspective.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, it provides an analytical overview of the various channels through which prudential regulation can affect economic growth. Second, it conducts an econometric analysis, using data for 64 countries over the period 1990-2014. These cover the effects on economic growth of prudential policies, financial development, and the degree of financial openness, both separately and jointly. In doing so, the paper goes beyond existing studies, whose focus has been more narrowly defined in terms of the effects of prudential policies on growth, without accounting for the fact that financial development or financial openness could also significantly affect this relationship.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results show that growth may be promoted by prudential policies that seek to mitigate financial risks to the economy. At the same time, financial openness tends to reduce the growth benefits of these policies. This may reflect either greater opportunities to borrow abroad or increased scope for cross-border leakages in regulation.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies the effects of prudential regulation, financial development, and financial openness on economic growth. Using both existing models and a new OLG framework with banking and prudential regulation in the form of capital requirements, the first part presents an analytical review of the various channels through which prudential regulation can affect growth. The second part provides a reduced-form empirical analysis, based on panel regressions for a sample of 64 advanced and developing economies. The results show that growth may be promoted by prudential policies whose goal is to mitigate financial risks to the economy. At the same time, financial openness tends to reduce the growth benefits of these policies, possibly because of either greater opportunities to borrow abroad or increased scope for cross-border leakages in regulation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When the cap on the Swiss franc's exchange rate against the euro was removed in January 2015, an ideal opportunity arose to study the effects of a large and sudden currency appreciation on an otherwise stable macroeconomic environment. We use this case study to shed light on how currency shocks affect prices, and to illuminate the knock-on effects on consumer behaviour.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our main contribution is to trace how the exchange rate shock first affected import prices at the border and then retail prices, and how household spending responded to the resulting price changes. We combine data on invoicing currencies and wholesale prices at the Swiss-EU border with transaction-level information on prices and spending in stores. First, we quantify the sources of incomplete pass-through to consumer prices. Second, we investigate the impact of the appreciation on pass-through into border prices, and how it is related to invoicing. Third, we show how such border price changes pass through into the retail prices of imported goods, and ultimately, how retail price changes influenced household spending.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that border prices invoiced in Swiss francs fell on average by 5% in response to the roughly 15% appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro by mid-2015, while the prices of euro-invoiced goods fell by 12%. Retail prices, which on average fell by only 1.3%, were in turn affected by changes in prices at the border: a 1 percentage point larger cut in import prices at the border resulted in a 0.3-0.4 percentage point larger price cut for imported products. These price changes induced households to buy more imported goods than Swiss-produced goods. We provide evidence that the currency of invoicing of border prices matters for the response of consumer prices and expenditures. Finally, we show that, while the prices of imported goods were cut more frequently in the aftermath of the appreciation, the cuts were, on average, smaller. This contributed to low pass-through into import prices.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The removal of the lower bound on the EUR/CHF exchange rate in January 2015 provides a unique setting to study the implications of a large and sudden appreciation in an otherwise stable macroeconomic environment. Using transaction-level data on non-durable goods purchases by Swiss consumers, we measure the response of border and consumer retail prices to the CHF appreciation and how household expenditures responded to these price changes. Consumer prices of imported goods and of competing Swiss-produced goods fell by more in product categories with larger reductions in border prices and a lower share of CHF-invoiced border prices. These price changes resulted in substantial expenditure switching between imported and Swiss-produced goods. While the frequency of import retail price reductions rose in the aftermath of the appreciation, the average size of these price reductions fell (and more so in product categories with larger border price declines and a lower share of CHF-invoiced border prices), contributing to low pass-through into import prices.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Can central banks stimulate economic activity when they cannot cut short-term interest rates any further? This is particularly relevant when rates are close to zero and cannot fall further, for example in Japan since 2000, the United States from 2008 to 2015 and the euro area since 2013. Might central bank communication on future interest rates, a policy known as forward guidance, stimulate demand and eventually inflation? In particular, how has the private sector interpreted the US Federal Reserve's pledge not to increase rates before a pre-announced ("fixed") date?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We analyse the impact of the Fed's fixed-date forward guidance. In August 2011, the Fed initially announced it would not raise rates before mid-2013. In 2012, the Fed twice extended the horizon for keeping rates near zero and said it would not increase rates before 2015. The work contributes to the debate about the effectiveness of forward guidance policies and, in particular, the risks that they will not necessarily result in a looser monetary policy stance.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The Fed's fixed-date forward guidance helped to coordinate expectations of future interest rates. All professional forecasters reached an unprecedented consensus that future interest rates would stay close to zero for two years. But their expectations for future economic growth varied. One group of "pessimist" forecasters saw the Fed announcements as signalling a deteriorating outlook. Another group, the "optimists", saw the guidance as a promise of further monetary stimulus. Thus, they lifted their forecasts for growth and inflation while lowering their expectations for future interest rate rises. Since only "optimists" would react by increasing spending, our findings suggest forward guidance is most effective when observers see it as a promise of future stimulus. This supports the argument that, unless central banks can make this more explicit when explaining their policy frameworks, forward guidance may fail to stimulate economic growth. In fact, it may even deter it.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Central banks' announcements that rates are expected to remain low could signal either a weak macroeconomic outlook, which would slow expenditure, or a more accommodative stance, which may stimulate economic activity. We use the Survey of Professional Forecasters to show that, when the Fed gave guidance between Q3 2011 and Q4 2012, these two interpretations co-existed despite a consensus on low expected rates. We rationalise these facts in a New-Keynesian model where heterogeneous beliefs introduce a trade-off in forward guidance policy: leveraging on the optimism of those who believe in monetary easing comes at the cost of inducing excessive pessimism in non-believers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper seeks to analyse how lending conditions responded to ECB President Mario Draghi's "whatever it takes" speech on 23 July 2012, as an example of a major, unconventional central bank intervention. It does so by comparing credit granted and its terms by individual banks to the same borrower in a country not directly targeted by the intervention.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Draghi's "whatever it takes" speech was a watershed for the euro area. It addressed a severe deterioration in financial and economic conditions in 2011 and early 2012. To ameliorate these conditions, the ECB President implicitly promised to provide unlimited support to financial institutions, markets and countries in the euro area. With its scale and unexpected character, the declaration had large beneficial effects on the stock prices and credit spreads of banks and sovereigns. By making banks safer, it also made them less prone to take risks.</p>
<p>We study how this large, unconventional central bank intervention in Europe influenced the credit conditions of banks in Mexico. This has several advantages. First, Mexico's financial system was relatively unaffected by the euro crisis, allowing us to disentangle the effects of the intervention from the factors that led to up to it. Second, foreign banks, whether European or otherwise, have an important presence in Mexico, and these banks are differentially exposed to shocks and official policy actions. Third, Mexican authorities collect detailed information on the lending relationships between banks and borrowers. Together, this allows us to cleanly identify and measure the effects of the intervention.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that the intervention reversed prior risk-taking - in terms of volume, price and risk ratings - by subsidiaries of euro area banks relative to other local and foreign banks. While, before the intervention, euro area banks were pricing their loans more aggressively than other banks were, afterwards lending standards fell back into line with those of other banks. Our results thus document a new effect of interventions: when a bank's franchise value is under pressure, say due to a worsening home market, it may aim to preserve its overall profitability by taking on more risk globally. We show that central bank interventions can reverse this behaviour ex post. Preferably, this would be done ex ante. But this risk-taking can be difficult to detect in real time. Our analysis thus suggests the need to pre-emptively adapt the cross-border regulation, supervision and resolution of global banks to make these measures well integrated, so as to ensure not only that risks do not go undetected, but also that incentives remain well aligned.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We assess how a major, unconventional central bank intervention, Draghi's "whatever it takes" speech, affected lending conditions. Similar to other large interventions, it responded to adverse financial and macroeconomic developments that also influenced the supply and demand for credit. We avoid such endogeneity concerns by comparing credit granted and its conditions by individual banks to the same borrower in a third country. We show that the intervention reversed prior risk-taking - in volume, price, and risk ratings - by subsidiaries of euro area banks relative to other local and foreign banks. Our results document a new effect of interventions and are robust along many dimensions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>It is critical to understand the changes globalisation brought to the inflation process after the financial crisis. To what degree do domestic versus global factors, such as output gaps, drive inflation? How has the role of these output gaps evolved since the financial crisis? And to what degree does the inflation process differ between advanced economies and less well studied emerging market economies?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper investigates these questions in a framework - the New Keynesian Phillips curve framework - which allows the results to be interpreted for monetary policy. The investigation uncovers very different trends between advanced and emerging market economies. And, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that explicitly addresses the issue of the strong co-movement across global and domestic output gaps when estimating their effects on inflation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find broadly that both domestic and global output gaps matter: both across regions (advanced and emerging market economies) and across time (before and after the financial crisis.) Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence for very different trends between advanced and emerging market economies after the global financial crisis: whereas in advanced economies the effect of the domestic output gap declines, in emerging market economies it is the effect of the global output gap that declines.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study how domestic and global output gaps affect CPI inflation. We use a New Keynesian Phillips curve framework, which controls for non-linear exchange rate movements for a panel of 26 advanced and 22 emerging economies covering the 1994Q1-2017Q4 period. We find broadly that both global and domestic output gaps are significant drivers of inflation both in the pre-crisis (1994-2008) and post-crisis (2008-2017) periods. Furthermore, after the crisis, in advanced economies the effect of the domestic output gap declines, while in emerging economies the effect of the global output gap declines. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the New Keynesian Phillips curve in identifying the impact of global and domestic output gaps on inflation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We assess how a bank's capitalisation influences the conditions on its corporate loans, including the volume and spread. We use a supervisory data set that includes almost all individual corporate loans for the United States.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>A bank's lending conditions are influenced by the state of its balance sheet. The challenge is to correctly identify how this link works, and how strongly. This paper's contribution is to study the link between the characteristics of a bank's balance sheet and its lending conditions by using a natural experiment and applying various statistical techniques.</p>
<p>Specifically, we look at how unexpected adjustments to banks' internal rating systems are mapped to a uniform external rating scale. Such adjustments do not change the riskiness of the borrower nor do they alter the pool of existing borrowers. The adjustments only change how outsiders, including bank regulators, assess the riskiness of borrowers. Studying how the effects of adjustments vary across banks lets us then establish how the state of the balance sheet actually influences loan conditions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that rating adjustments trigger changes in loan terms that are asymmetrical: downward adjustments increase spreads by some 40 bps and reduce committed loan sizes and maturities. By contrast, upward adjustments lead to much weaker (yet opposite) effects. Importantly, we find these effects to be stronger for smaller, riskier, and banks with less capital strength, as well as for borrowers with poorer credit quality and for non-guaranteed loans. Other tests confirm that the risk weighting under the capital adequacy requirements, which are in part based on ratings, helps to explain these effects. Results remain valid after controlling for bank characteristics, other shocks, and various changes in samples, among other tests. Overall, our evidence suggests that regulatory capital affects loan terms, but in an asymmetrical manner.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Through the lens of credit risk ratings, we investigate how banks determine loan terms under capital constraints. Using a unique and comprehensive supervisory dataset of individual corporate loans in the US, we show that unexpected adjustments to banks' internal rating systems, which only alter how outsiders assess the riskiness of borrowers, trigger changes in loan terms. The effects are asymmetric: downward adjustments to ratings increase spreads by some 40 bps and decrease committed loan sizes and maturities, but upward adjustments lead to much weaker (yet opposite) effects. Importantly, we find effects to be strong for smaller, riskier, and capital constrained banks as well as for borrowers with poorer credit quality and for non-guaranteed loans. Our findings, robust in several ways, highlight the important role of regulatory capital in loan terms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The literature on the behaviour of global banks has focused more on cross-border than on local lending. The distinction between the two types of lending is important for two reasons. First, local lending is much more stable, growing more slowly during expansions and shrinking less sharply during bad times. Second, local lending has grown much more important over the past two decades.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use bank-level data to look at the factors that determine local lending by banks' foreign subsidiaries. More concretely, we compare the importance of factors that are specific to the host country with those that are specific to a bank's owner. We estimate the impact of host-specific factors by comparing the lending behaviour of subsidiaries that are located in different countries but have the same parent. We estimate the impact of owner-specific factors by comparing the lending behaviour of subsidiaries that are located in the same country but have different parents.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that host-specific factors tend to influence local lending by global banks more strongly than owner-specific factors do. Specifically, the state of the host country's economy and the financial health of local subsidiaries are more important than the macroeconomic conditions in parent countries and the financial condition of a bank's parent company.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We find that the lending behaviour of global banks' subsidiaries throughout the world is more closely related to local macroeconomic conditions and their financial conditions than to those of their owner-specific counterparts. This inference is drawn from a panel dataset populated with bank-level observations from the Bankscope database. Using this database, we identify ownership structures and incorporate them into a unique methodology that identifies and compares the owner and subsidiary-specific determinants of lending. A distinctive feature of our analysis is that we use multi-dimensional country-level data from the BIS international banking statistics to account for exchange rate fluctuations and cross-border lending. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study if financial stress in countries where international banks are headquartered is a major driver of capital outflows from emerging market economies (EMEs). We use data on bilateral banking outflows from 67 EMEs using BIS consolidated and locational banking statistics for 27 and 29 lender countries, respectively. We also examine which component of international lending to EMEs is more susceptible to financial stress in lender countries.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>As proxies for financial stress in lender countries, we use bank CDS spread, sovereign CDS spread and corporate bond spread. In addition, we decompose foreign bank claims in various components, such as cross-border claims, local claims in foreign currency and local claims in local currency by estimating the first two components from BIS consolidated banking statistics.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that when financial stress of lender countries increases, international banks decrease their lending to EMEs, which acts as a major driver of capital outflows from EMEs. In particular, financial stress in lender countries is a more important driver than the local financial conditions and macroeconomic fundamentals of EMEs. When we consider the subcomponents of the total amount of international lending, cross-border lending to EMEs is more susceptible to financial stress in lender countries than is local lending in foreign currency.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate if financial stress in countries where international banks are headquartered is a major driver of banking outflows from emerging market economies (EMEs). We find that when financial stress measured by sovereign or bank CDS spread or corporate bond spread increases, international banks decrease their lending to EMEs, which acts as a major driver of capital outflows from EMEs. In particular, financial stress in lender countries is a more important driver than the local financial conditions and macroeconomic fundamentals of EMEs. Such results generally hold even after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period, but to a lesser extent. When we divide the total amount of international lending into subcomponents, cross-border lending to EMEs is more susceptible to financial stress in lender countries than is local lending, and that local lending in foreign currency is more stable than is cross-border lending. Our findings suggest that it is desirable for EME policymakers to promote diversification of lender countries and induce more borrowing from local subsidiaries than cross-border lenders.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Excessive credit growth is part and parcel of any financial boom and bust. But what is "excessive"? There is no clear cut answer to this question, so researchers use proxies. Typically, credit is divided, or "normalised", by some variable such as GDP so that it can be compared across time and between countries. The gap between the level of normalised credit and some "trend" level is then used as a proxy for excessive credit growth. </p>
<p>The BIS was the first to develop a credit-to-GDP gap measure and show that this is a useful crisis early warning indicator. As such it was adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as a guide for setting countercyclical capital buffers. It involves normalising credit by GDP and measuring the trend using a one-sided Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter. </p>
<p>However, this measure has been criticised because the HP filter has some undesirable statistical properties. Also, credit and GDP may move together. From a conceptual perspective, we agree with these criticisms. But, in the absence of clear theoretical foundations, any proposed gap measure should be treated only as a proxy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We run a horse race between the baseline gap and alternatives that have been suggested to fix these problems. In particular, we assess how well the different gap measures predict financial crises up to three years ahead in a panel of 42 economies between 1970 and 2017. In addition to normalising credit with GDP, we also consider normalisations based on population. And we look at trends based not only on the HP filter but also based on five-year growth rates and local projections.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that no other gap measure outperforms the baseline credit-to-GDP gap. Across many forecast horizons and subsample specifications, the baseline gap is either the best or very close to (and not statistically significantly different from) the best predictor of crises using a standard measure to judge performance. Some other gaps do almost as well. But gaps based on linear projections perform poorly.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The credit gap, defined as the deviation of the credit-to-GPD ratio from a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filtered trend, is a powerful early warning indicator for predicting crises. Basel III therefore suggests that policymakers should use it as part of their countercyclical capital buffer frameworks. Hamilton (2017), however, argues that you should never use an HP filter as it results in spurious dynamics, has end-point problems and its typical implementation is at odds with its statistical foundations. Instead he proposes the use of linear projections. Some have also criticised the normalisation by GDP, since gaps will be negatively correlated with output. We agree with these criticisms. Yet, in the absence of clear theoretical foundations, all proposed gaps are but indicators. It is therefore an empirical question which measure performs best as an early warning indicator for crises - the question we address in this paper. We run a horse race using quarterly data from 1970 to 2017 for 42 economies. We find that no other gap outperforms the baseline credit-to-GDP gap. By contrast, credit gaps based on linear projections in real time perform poorly.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper sets out a macroeconomic model of international financial markets with market intermediaries such as brokers and dealers at its core. In our model, intermediaries use their market power to charge their customers a fee for providing them with trading access to foreign financial instruments. These additional costs ("rent extraction") distort the way that risks are shared internationally, altering both exchange rates and the prices paid for taking on or laying off risks. We show how this "intermediation friction" helps account for some major anomalies in foreign exchange and international capital markets.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Ours is the first model that shows how the market power of intermediaries can affect exchange rates. We explicitly link the dynamics of exchange rates to international risk factors and differences in expectations about how various countries will conduct their monetary policy. The model also explains why some countries will become safe havens, with currencies that strengthen in bad times. This is also the first model that shows how the normal relationship between interest rates and exchange rates ("covered interest parity") can break down in a widely used ("general equilibrium") macroeconomic model.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that demand for foreign exchange derivatives as a tool for insuring against the depreciation of a currency depends crucially on a country's exposure to global shocks as well as on how far its domestic monetary policy can act to stabilise the exchange rate. Differences between countries in their exposures to global shocks, as well as in the capacities of their financial sectors, help to explain why the US dollar serves as a safe haven currency, and also why it usually commands a premium in the foreign exchange swap market.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We develop a general equilibrium model with intermediaries at the heart of international financial markets. In our model, intermediaries bargain with their customers and extract rents for providing access to foreign claims. The behavior of intermediaries, by tilting state prices, generates an explicit, non-linear risk structure in exchange rates. We show how this endogenous risk structure helps explain a number of anomalies in foreign exchange and international capital markets, including the safe haven properties of exchange rates and the breakdown of covered interest parity.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Many central banks provide forward guidance about the expected path of short-term interest rates. However, different central banks communicate this information in different ways. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) was the first central bank to provide quantitative forward guidance: it publishes an interest rate forecast with every second monetary policy decision. And it accompanies all its policy decisions with a written statement about the state of the economy and the policy outlook, which includes qualitative guidance. This allows us to compare two types of forward guidance and their effects on market expectations.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In this paper, we use the different types of information that the RBNZ provides with its policy rate decisions to answer the following question: does it matter for the expectations of market participants as to the future monetary policy stance whether forward guidance is quantitative, by means of rate forecasts, or whether it is qualitative, in the form of policy statements?</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the RBNZ's forward guidance has significant effects on asset prices whether or not the information is quantitative or qualitative. Announcements that include an interest rate forecast and those that include only a written statement lead to a very similar market response across the yield curve. This suggests that earlier studies may overstate the effects on market prices of publishing rate forecasts. In other words, markets seem to draw much the same conclusions from written statements as they do from rate forecasts. Our results imply that central bank communication is important, but that the exact form of that communication is less critical. They also suggest that market participants understand rate forecasts as conditional, so that concerns about these being read as binding promises would seem to be unwarranted.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Every monetary policy decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is accompanied by a written statement about the state of the economy and the policy outlook, but only every second decision by a published interest rate forecast. We exploit this difference to study the relative influences of qualitative and quantitative forward guidance. We find that announcements that include an interest rate forecast lead to very similar market reactions across the yield curve as announcements that only include written statements. We interpret our results as implying that central bank communication is important, but that the exact form of that communication is less critical. Our results are also consistent with market participants understanding the conditional nature of the RBNZ interest rate forecasts.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Central banks in Latin America have actively used reserve requirements. During economic booms and periods of large capital inflows, central banks have increased reserve requirements and kept policy rates unchanged. This policy can be effective when it tightens monetary conditions and does not attract further capital inflows. While raising policy rates would have increased loan and deposit rates, increased reserve requirements have asymmetric effects: loan rates increase and deposit rates do not. If short-term capital flows are sensitive to the deposit rate, then adjustments in reserve requirements can be a better option than adjustments in policy rates.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We investigate how banks adjusted their loan and deposit rates in response to changes in policy rates and reserve requirements. Our study is the first to investigate this on the bank-level for a large part of the Latin American banking system. We allow in our model for differential responses across banks of different types and periods of large capital inflows. We calculate reserve requirements for each bank and consider the required reserve ratios for different types of deposits and reserve remuneration.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that higher reserve requirements are associated with higher loan rates. Deposit rates remain unchanged during normal times and decrease during periods of large capital inflows. We find that increases in policy rates lead to higher loan rates and higher deposit rates. This finding holds during normal times and during periods of large capital inflows. Our findings suggest that adjustments in reserve requirements may have helped to stabilize domestic credit growth in a way that moderated capital flows.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The experience of a number of central banks in emerging economies indicates that capital flows can pose a dilemma. For example, raising policy rates can attract more capital inflows by raising deposit rates. It has been suggested, however, that raising reserve requirements instead of the policy rate can address this dilemma, as deposit rates will not necessarily increase, even if lending rates rise. To investigate this possibility, this paper examines how banks adjust loan and deposit rates in response to changes in reserve requirements. We use data on 128 banks from seven Latin American countries over the period 2000-14. Our results indicate that higher reserve requirements are associated with higher loan rates, whereas deposit rates remain unchanged during normal times and decrease during periods of large capital inflows. Reserve requirements may therefore be a way to mitigate the dilemma posed by capital inflows in some Latin American economies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We measure the effects of changes in maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, an important macroprudential policy, on the core objectives of monetary policy to stabilise output and inflation for a panel of 56 economies over more than two decades. We also examine if such changes in maximum LTV ratios help moderate credit and asset price growth.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper is the first in the literature that uses a narrative approach to identify exogenous changes in macroprudential policy measures based on a detailed reading of policymakers' objectives. We also consider the size and scope of changes in maximum LTV ratios to capture the intensity of policy actions and their causal effects.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that changes in maximum LTV ratios have modest and imprecisely estimated effects on output and inflation. The output effect is more pronounced in emerging market economies than in advanced economies, and mainly driven by tightening LTV limits. We also find that tightening LTV limits reduces housing credit and house prices. Our results indicate that for central banks, macroprudential measures may serve as a complementary policy tool that does not interfere with the core objectives of monetary policy in a major way.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Central banks increasingly rely on macroprudential measures to manage the financial cycle, but the effects of such policies on the core objectives of monetary policy to stabilise output and inflation are largely unknown. In this paper, we quantify the effects of changes in maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on output and inflation. We rely on a narrative identification approach based on detailed reading of policymakers' objectives when implementing the measures. We find that over a four-year horizon, a 10 percentage point decrease in the maximum LTV ratio leads to a 1.1% reduction in output. As a rule of thumb, the impact of a 10 percentage point LTV tightening can be viewed as roughly comparable to that of a 25 basis point increase in the policy rate. However, the effects are imprecisely estimated and the effect is only present in emerging market economies. We also find that tightening LTV limits has larger economic effects than loosening them. At the same time, we show that changes in maximum LTV ratios have substantial effects on credit and house price growth. Using inverse propensity weights to re-randomise LTV actions, we show that these effects are likely causal.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Against a backdrop of rising protectionism, the paper sets out what could be at stake if the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were revoked. It looks at two hypothetical scenarios. In the first, tariffs that were lowered under NAFTA revert to those under standard World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules while non-tariff trade barriers revert to pre-NAFTA levels. Non-tariff trade barriers include concessions such as preferential customs treatment or import quotas. In the second scenario, only tariffs revert to standard WTO levels.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper uses NAFTA as an example to show how trade policy can affect individual regions and industries. The paper estimates the impact on real wages as well as economic output. It demonstrates NAFTA's importance for Canada, the United States and Mexico by nation, region and sector.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds that losses from revoking NAFTA would be widespread, given the interconnected nature of production in the three countries. Any benefits from reduced foreign competition would be offset by higher prices for imported intermediate goods and higher tariffs on exports. If tariffs and other trade barriers default to international norms, GDP would decline by 0.22% in the United States, 1.8% in Mexico and 2.2% in Canada. Total combined losses would be about US$ 99 billion a year. Real wages would fall in all Canadian provinces and Mexican states, and in all but one of the 435 US Congressional districts. Automotive workers would be hardest hit in Mexico and Canada; in the United States, it would be workers in oil refineries and coke production who stand to lose most. If tariffs increase but non-tariff trade barriers remain unchanged, annual combined economic losses would be less than US$ 5 billion. Most importantly, almost all regions in North America would see lower real wages in either scenario.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In a world economy interconnected by global value chains (GVCs), domestic productivity depends on the availability of imported inputs and the vast majority of workers stands to lose from protectionism. To exemplify this, we provide a quantitative assessment of the aggregate and distributional effects of one hypothetical protectionist measure - the case of revoking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Using a multi-country, multi-sector, quantitative model of global production, we show that a full revocation extending to both tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers would result in a real annual GDP loss of US$ 37 billion in Canada, US$ 22 billion in Mexico, and US$ 40 billion in the USA. In contrast, annual combined losses would amount to less than US$ 5 billion if only tariff rates were to be increased. For both counterfactuals, the distributional impacts across sectors would be an order of magnitude larger than the aggregate effects. Combining these results with information on the geographic distribution of sectoral employment, we show that almost all regions in North America would record reductions in their average real wage.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When banks are hit by a shock large enough to compromise their solvency, they are perceived as riskier by others. This makes it difficult for them to fund themselves at convenient rates. In this way, solvency risk can increase funding costs. Similarly, if a bank experiences a persistent increase in funding costs, its business model and ability to generate profits on a sustainable basis might be called into question. This may increase its solvency risk. Solvency risk and funding costs are thus two forces that can interact with and feed upon each other. Macroprudential policies may affect this interaction by improving the solvency position of banks.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We study the interaction between solvency risk and funding costs using two data sets that collect detailed information at the quarterly frequency for Korean commercial banks. We use unique data on marginal funding costs at the bank level. This is the right measure to look at when analysing solvency risk and funding cost interactions. We analyse the effect that FX-related macroprudential policies implemented in recent years had on the interaction between funding costs and solvency risk.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that an economically meaningful two-way negative interaction exists between solvency risk and marginal funding costs. A 100 basis point increase in marginal funding costs is associated with a 155 basis point reduction in the regulatory capital ratio. In turn, a 100 basis point increase in the regulatory capital ratio is associated with a 77 basis point decrease in marginal funding costs. The findings pass a series of robustness checks. We also show that using average funding costs, as normally done in the literature, can lead to the wrong conclusion about the link between solvency risk and funding costs. FX-related macroprudential measures were able to affect the negative interaction by muting the effect that marginal funding costs have on solvency risk.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Using proprietary balance sheet data for Korean banks and a simultaneous equation model, we document that increased marginal funding costs lead to larger solvency risk (as measured by the Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio), which, in turn, leads to larger marginal funding costs. A 100 bp increase in marginal funding costs (solvency risk) is associated with a 155 (77) bp increase in solvency risk (marginal funding costs). The findings of an economically and statistically significant relationship are robust to considering different proxies for solvency risk, types of banks, interest rate regimes, and interest margin management strategies. They also hold irrespective of the funding profile considered. FX-related macroprudential policies can affect the negative feedback loop by muting the effect of marginal funding costs on solvency risk. Our findings can inform the calibration of macroprudential stress tests.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper examines how monetary policy changes in various countries affect international bank lending. Most of the existing literature looks at monetary conditions in one or two countries, that of the lender or that of the borrower. But when banks lend across borders, they do so mostly in a global currency (US dollars or euros), which may be neither the lender's nor the borrower's home currency. Do interest rates in a third country also affect the volume of bank lending between the two countries?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We examine the effect of three countries' monetary policies at the same time to determine whose policy matters for international bank lending. The data we use tracks banks in 32 countries and their lending to 55 countries from quarter to quarter since 2000. The way we measure how banks respond to changes in interest rates builds on the joint initiative of the International Banking Research Network.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that all three policies affect international bank lending. When US interest rates fall, cross-border bank lending in dollars tends to increase outside the United States. By contrast, monetary easing in the lender or the borrower country reduces cross-border lending. Similar results, but weaker, hold for bank lending in euros. Overall, the findings suggest that monetary policies spill over across countries <em>and</em> currencies.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper explores the basic question of whose monetary policy matters for banks' international lending. In the international context, monetary policies from several countries could come into play: the lender's, the borrower's, and that of a third country, the issuer of the currency in which cross-border lending is denominated. Using the rich dimensionality of the BIS international banking statistics, we find significant effects for all three policies. US monetary easing fuels cross-border lending in US dollars, as befits a global funding currency. At the same time, a tightening in the lender or the borrower country reinforces international dollar lending as global banks turn to the greenback for cheaper funding and toward borrowers abroad. Our results also show that stronger capitalization and better access to funding sources mitigate the frictions underpinning the transmission channels. Analogous results for euro-denominated lending confirm that global funding currencies play a key role in international monetary policy transmission.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Household debt has risen sharply around the globe in the past two decades. There is growing interest in the relationship between household debt and consumption. Previous studies show highly indebted households are more sensitive to income changes than those with little-to-no debt. A better understanding of the relationship would help policymakers respond appropriately to changing economic and debt conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This study uses Japanese household survey data to analyse the impact of debt burdens on consumption. One unique feature is the ability to use survey information about households' concerns about future unemployment spells and saving sufficiently for old age. We investigate how these concerns influence current consumption decisions.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Japanese households tend to save more when they have a higher level of debt. In particular, they are sensitive to unexpected declines in income. These results are consistent with findings for other countries. The households' concerns about the latter stages of life and (unlikely) unemployment risks are seen as key motives for household precautionary saving, especially for middle-age households (from the late 30s to the early 60s). This implies that well funded pension and health insurance systems could reduce the sensitivity of households' consumption behaviour to income changes.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper estimates the impact of household debt on consumption behaviour using data from the Japanese Preference Parameters Study. Covering the 2005-13 period, the survey is the first of its kind for Japan. It features responses to forward-looking questions about key risks to income, shedding light on the motives for household savings behaviour. The analysis finds that household marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) were significantly higher for highly-indebted Japanese households than for those with little-to-no debt - a type of variation that is consistent with findings for other countries. The evidence points to a significant precautionary saving motive by Japanese households, with savers particularly concerned about (unlikely) future unemployment spells and longevity risks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>A review of the run-up to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis underlines the usefulness of slow-moving balance sheet aggregates in signalling the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. We show how the BIS international banking and financial statistics might have been used in this way. We use the same statistics to look at current vulnerabilities in the global financial system.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We put ourselves in the shoes of a contemporary observer during the run-up to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, using data available at the time. We reconstruct a narrative of events through a chart pack of banking and financial developments. We use the BIS international banking and financial statistics to show that international credit intermediation has shifted from banks to capital markets.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The BIS international banking statistics captured the build-up of vulnerabilities in the run-up to the Asian Financial Crisis. In particular, vulnerable economies could have been identified by combining information on the levels and growth rates of cross-border bank credit. The BIS data also reveal that the boom in international credit was fuelled mainly by short-term interbank lending denominated in US dollars. In recent years, debt securities have become an increasingly important source of funding for EME corporations and other non-banks.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We look back at past episodes of financial stress in Asia with a forward-looking perspective. We put ourselves in the shoes of a contemporary observer with the data at hand and ask what evidence was available on the systematic build-up of vulnerabilities. We reconstruct a graphical narrative of banking and financial developments at the time. Our exercise showcases the usefulness of the BIS international banking and financial statistics as a window on the financial system's procyclicality. We conclude with a real-time forward-looking survey of current financial vulnerabilities, focusing on the implications of the shift in the pattern of credit intermediation from banks to bond markets.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In modern economies, transactions occur in two layers. In the end user layer, households, firms and institutional investors pay for goods and securities with inside money (payment instruments supplied by banks). In the bank layer, end users' payment instructions to banks generate interbank transactions, which are often made with reserves - outside money - via central banks' real time gross settlement systems, but may also be handled through short-term credit including interbank netting arrangements. Models of monetary policy are typically based on these institutional features.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We model the determination of asset prices and inflation in an economy with a layered payment system that supports trade in both goods and securities. In both the bank and end user layers, money is valued for its liquidity services, but its creation requires costly leverage. What happens in securities markets then matters for both the supply and the demand of inside money: securities are held by banks to back inside money, which is in turn used by other investors to pay for securities. As a result, asset prices, inflation and policy transmission depend on the institutional details of the payment system.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We see that when investors are unwilling to hold the economy' risk, equilibrium in asset markets is typically restored through a reduction in interest rates. If interest rates are constrained from below (the zero lower bound), a decrease in risk appetite instead ushers in asset price declines that drag down aggregate demand, which further drags down asset prices. Output and risk-gaps emerge simultaneously and are mutually reinforcing. These mechanisms seem to have played out forcefully in the past, particularly during the Great Financial Crisis. Yet mainstream macroeconomic models focus exclusively on the output gap component, while the risk-gap component plays only a secondary or no role.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies a modern monetary economy: trade in both goods and securities relies on money provided by intermediaries. While money is valued for its liquidity, its creation requires costly leverage. In ation, security prices and the transmission of monetary policy then depend on the institutional details of the payment system. The price of a security is higher if it helps back inside money, and lower if more inside money is used to trade it. In ation can be low in security market busts if bank portfolios suffer, but also in booms if trading absorbs more money. The government has multiple policy tools: in addition to the return on outside money, it affects the mix of securities used to back inside money.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>When investors are unwilling to hold the economy's risk, equilibrium in asset markets is typically restored through a decline in interest rates. If interest rates are constrained from below (the zero lower bound), falling risk appetite instead entails asset price declines that drag down aggregate demand, which then further depresses asset prices. Output and risk gaps emerge side by side and reinforce each other. These mechanisms seem to have played out forcefully at various times in the past, notably during the Great Financial Crisis. Yet, in mainstream macroeconomic models, the focus is exclusively on the output gap component, while the risk gap component plays only a secondary role, if any.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper develops a macro-finance model that features mutually reinforcing feedback loops between the output and risk gaps. The model incorporates aggregate demand channels and investor speculation arising from disagreement in beliefs about economic prospects. Volatility shocks generate time-varying risk premia while the interest rate is constrained by the zero lower bound. As a result, mutually reinforcing feedback loops between asset prices and output demand can ensue in case of a negative financial shock. The share of optimistic investors is a key stabilising factor in a downswing, as it limits the scope for asset price declines.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper demonstrates how the zero lower bound on interest rates can constrain the capacity of monetary policy to stabilise asset markets and the economy in the case of an adverse financial shock. Macroprudential policy that curbs speculation by optimistic investors in the boom can mitigate downward spirals in the bust as it safeguards optimistic investors from suffering heavy losses during downturns, thus preserving their stabilising role.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>When investors are unwilling to hold the economy's risk, a decline in the interest rate increases the Sharpe ratio of the market and equilibrates the risk markets. If the interest rate is constrained from below, risk markets are instead equilibrated via a decline in asset prices. However, the latter drags down aggregate demand, which further drags prices down, and so on. If investors are pessimistic about the recovery, the economy becomes highly susceptible to downward spirals due to dynamic feedbacks between asset prices, aggregate demand, and potential growth. In this context, belief disagreements generate highly destabilizing speculation that motivates macroprudential policy.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Over the past 25 years, policymakers have set interest rates with reference to feedback rules based on estimates of both potential output and the real policy rate. The latter - often known as the "neutral" real policy rate (or r*) - is the rate that keeps potential output and prices stable, as defined by the central bank's inflation target. Pre-crisis, policymakers often made the simplifying assumption that r* is constant. But the more recent literature suggests that r* can change with time. This implies that shocks to r* should be factored into rules that govern policy rate-setting decisions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper highlights some of the theoretical and practical implications for monetary policy and exchange rates that derive from considering the presence of a time-varying r*. Using a standard two-country DSGE model, the paper derives a structural decomposition in which the nominal exchange rate is a function of the expected present value of future neutral real interest rate differentials, plus a business cycle factor and a purchasing power parity factor. The paper also considers the possibility for international spillovers and evaluates the net benefits of international policy cooperation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In this richer model, we obtain a similar decomposition for the nominal exchange rate, but with the added feature that r* in each country is a function of global productivity and business cycle factors even if these factors vary independently across countries.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper highlights some of the theoretical and practical implications for monetary policy and exchange rates that derive specifically from the presence of a global general equilibrium factor embedded in neutral real policy rates in open economies. Using a standard two country DSGE model, we derive a structural decomposition in which the nominal exchange rate is a function of the expected present value of future neutral real interest rate differentials plus a business cycle factor and a PPP factor. Country specific "r*" shocks in general require optimal monetary policy to pass these through to the policy rate, but such shocks will also have exchange rate implications, with an expected decline in the path of the real neutral policy rate reflected in a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. We document a novel empirical regularity between the equilibrium error in the VECM representation of the empirical Holston Laubach Williams (2017) four country r* model and the value of the nominal trade weighted dollar. In fact, the correlation between the dollar and the 12 quarter lag of the HLW equilibrium error is estimated to be 0.7. Global shocks to r* under optimal policy require no exchange rate adjustment because passing though r* shocks to policy rates 'does all the work' of maintaining global equilibrium. We also study a richer model with international spill overs so that in theory there can be gains to international policy cooperation. In this richer model we obtain a similar decomposition for the nominal exchange rate, but with the added feature that r* in each country is a function global productivity and business cycle factors even if these factors are themselves independent across countries. We argue that in practice, there could well be significant costs to central bank communication and credibility under a regime formal policy cooperation, but that gains to policy coordination could be substantial given that r*'s are unobserved but are correlated across countries.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper estimates the probability that the economy will hit its effective lower bound for the nominal interest rate (ELB risk), ie the likelihood that the monetary authority will not be able to reduce its monetary policy rate to further ease monetary policy and must therefore consider unconventional measures. In addition, the paper provides estimates of the expected duration of such an event. The study focuses on eight advanced economies (Canada, the euro area, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States). It also examines the differences between the ELB risk estimates found in the literature.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper provides ELB risk estimates that are based on a fully estimated empirical model. So far, most studies have drawn on calibrated models and assumptions about the steady-state values of macroeconomic variables. The approach in this paper makes use of data on recent actual ELB events in advanced countries. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the discussion on why some frameworks provide unrealistically high estimates of ELB risk. From the econometric point of view, the paper's contribution lies in combining recent econometric techniques and applying them to all considered countries simultaneously.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper provides estimates of the ELB risk for the short and medium run. It finds that the differences in ELB risk estimates between various frameworks stem from three factors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>whether the steady states (especially the interest rate steady state) are assumed or estimated;</li>
<li>whether the uncertainty of the steady state is a part of the estimation procedure; and</li>
<li>whether the model is non-linear.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper provides estimates of the probability of an economy hitting its effective lower bound (ELB) on the nominal interest rate and of the expected duration of such an event for eight advanced economies. To that end, a mean-adjusted panel vector autoregression with static interdependencies and the possibility of regime change is estimated. The simulation procedure produces ELB risk estimates for both the short term, where the current phase of the business cycle plays an important role, and the medium term, where the occurrence of an ELB situation is determined mainly by the equilibrium values of macroeconomic variables. The paper also discusses the ELB event probability estimates with respect to previous approaches used in the literature.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>What is the impact of U.S. monetary policy on cross-border bank lending? There is no consensus in the empirical literature. Some papers have found that the impact is negative, while others have found a positive relationship or mixed results.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use an innovative approach to reconcile the seemingly contradictory findings of the existing literature. We depart from it along two key dimensions. First, we identify two distinct regimes in international bank lending: a boom regime and a stagnation regime. Second, we decompose the federal funds rate into two distinct components: a macroeconomic fundamentals component and a monetary policy stance component.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the impact of the U.S. federal funds rate on cross-border bank lending depends on the prevailing capital flow regime and on the level of the two main federal funds rate components. During booms, the relationship between the federal funds rate and cross-border bank lending is positive and mostly driven by the macroeconomic fundamentals component. This is consistent with search for yield by internationally-active banks. During stagnation episodes, the relationship between the federal funds rate and bank lending is negative, mainly due to the monetary policy stance component of the federal funds rate. The latter set of results is most pronounced for lending to emerging market economies, which is consistent with the international bank lending channel and flight-to-quality behavior of internationally-active banks.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>There is no consensus in the empirical literature on the direction in which U.S. monetary policy affects cross-border bank lending. We find robust evidence that the impact of the U.S. federal funds rate on cross-border bank lending in a given period depends on the prevailing international capital flows regime and on the level of the two main components of the federal funds rate: macroeconomic fundamentals and the monetary policy stance. During episodes in which bank lending from advanced to emerging economies is booming, the relationship between the federal funds rate and cross-border bank lending is positive and mostly driven by the macroeconomic fundamentals component, which is consistent with a search-for-yield behavior on the part of internationally-active banks. In contrast, during episodes of stagnant growth in bank lending from advanced to emerging economies, the relationship between the federal funds rate and bank lending is negative, mainly due to the monetary policy stance component of the federal funds rate. The latter set of results is most pronounced for lending to emerging markets, which is consistent with the international bank-lending channel and flight-to-quality behavior of internationally-active banks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, oil prices have become highly correlated with inflation expectations for the medium term. This occurred in several countries, implying a global phenomenon. To trace its origins, we decompose oil prices into two factors: one capturing global aggregate demand and the second capturing oil-specific elements. Our measure of global demand is based on the strong co-movement of commodity prices. The oil-specific elements include OPEC's strategic behavior and shocks to oil demand caused by the weather. We use this decomposition to explain changes in global inflation expectations.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Central bankers were concerned that the increased correlation between inflation expectations and oil prices might indicate an un-anchoring of expectations. If this were the case, the credibility of inflation targeting might be declining. We test for un-anchoring using a framework based on a global Phillips curve. This framework allows us to trace the origins of the change that occurred after the global crisis.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that global aggregate demand has affected inflation expectations more since the crisis than it did in the past. Meanwhile, the effect of oil-specific factors remained low and stable. Since oil prices convey information about aggregate demand, their correlation with expectations has increased. Does this change indicate that expectations became un-anchored? Our model for global expectations suggests otherwise. We find that, after the crisis, inflation itself was perceived to react more strongly to aggregate demand. Rational agents thus adjusted their expectations more strongly when aggregate conditions changed. It appears that inflation targeting has remained credible.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Beginning with the global financial crisis (2008) the correlation between crude oil prices and medium-term and forward inflation expectations increased leading to fears of their un-anchoring. Using the first principal component of commodity prices as a measure for global aggregate demand, we decompose nominal oil prices to a global demand factor and remaining factors. Using a Phillips Curve framework we find a structural change after the collapse of Lehman Brothers when inflation expectations reacted more strongly to global aggregate demand conditions embedded in oil prices. Within this framework we cannot reject the hypothesis that expectations remained anchored.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Our starting point is to ask if the accumulation of official foreign exchange reserves may have unintended consequences in the form of increased private sector risk-taking. This is a topical question, given the substantial stocks of reserves held by some central banks. We focus on the relationship between the accumulation of reserves and risk-taking in 10 Asia-Pacific economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We assess whether the accumulation of reserves has systematic effects on private sector risk-taking with an event study analysis using daily data. The event study methodology allows us to consider, without having to specify and estimate time series models, whether changes in reserves holdings influence various proxy measures of risk-taking. Our main proxy measure of risk-taking is the implied volatility of currency options, which can be interpreted as the cost of insuring against exchange rate changes. If the accumulation of reserves leads to an increase in risk-taking, we are likely to see a decline in the cost of insuring against exchange rate changes. Thus the implied volatility of currency options would be systematically associated with changes in reserve holdings.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We do not find that reserves announcements are systematically associated with changes in risk-taking. Put simply, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no systematic relationship between reserves announcements and risk-taking for any of the economies considered. Thus, our results do not indicate that central banks need to consider unintended risk-taking effects of the accumulation of reserves. We discuss some limitations of our study and suggest possible avenues for future research on the accumulation of reserves and risk-taking.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div>
  We assess whether the accumulation of foreign currency reserves in the Asia-Pacific region may have unintended consequences in the form of increased private sector risk-taking. To do so we carry out a country-specific daily data event study analysis of the relationship between official announcements of reserves stocks and various proxy measures of risk-taking. Overall, our results suggest that reserves accumulation exerts no significant influence on risk-taking.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How do the Chinese authorities fix the centre of the renminbi's daily trading band? To what extent do other emerging market currencies track renminbi moves against the dollar? Both questions interest policymakers, academics and market participants. Their interest only grew more intense when the renminbi fixing reform in August 2015 shook global markets. This working paper finds that the answers to these two questions are closely related.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We find that recent variation in the renminbi's daily fixing maps onto how emerging market currencies move with the renminbi. We first identify three phases of the fixing since its reform in August 2015. We label them as the transition, basket management and countercyclical management phases. These differ in the strength of the fixing's response to lagged market moves. We then measure how much emerging market currencies in and outside Asia move with the renminbi in each phase. Their co-movement peaked during the basket management phase with its more multilateral fixings. Then, after May 2017, co-movement dropped in the countercyclical phase when yesterday's dollar moves had no effect on today's fixing.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In sum, a renminbi that responds more to market moves seems to make other currencies co-move more with it. It enlarges the renminbi zone of economies with currencies that share most of the currency's moves against the dollar. It is too soon to tell whether this link will develop into a stable renminbi zone (or "bloc"). The link has implications also for prospects for wider global use of the renminbi.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This study investigates how variation in the determinants of the renminbi's daily fixing since the August 2015 exchange rate reform maps on to variation in the co- movement of the renminbi with regional and other emerging market currencies. We first identify three post-reform periods of RMB management: transition, basket management and countercyclical management. The co-movement with regional and Latin American currencies peaked in the basket period, when the daily fixing was most predictable and multilateral. By contrast, the decline in co-movement in the countercyclical management period between May and July 2017 leaves it premature to speak of a renminbi zone. The dependence of the co-movements on renminbi management has important implications for renminbi internationalisation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper studies the evolution and key drivers of residential investment in 15 advanced economies since the 1970s. It also analyses how residential investment growth affects overall economic activity and the likelihood of recessions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Most previous research on housing markets has focused on house <em>prices</em>, whereas research on housing <em>quantities</em> - ie residential investment - has been scarce. There has also been little cross-country analysis of the determinants of residential investment. This paper partly fills this gap. It studies the key drivers of residential investment across countries and the impact of residential investment on the broader economy. We provide novel evidence on the effects of monetary policy on the residential investment cycle, highlighting the asymmetric effects of rising and falling interest rates.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the key drivers of residential investment in advanced economies are house price growth, net migration, the size of the housing stock and nominal interest rates. Importantly, rising interest rates have stronger effects on residential investment than falling ones. This could result from downward rigidity in house prices, which forces housing construction rather than prices to fall as interest rates rise. We also show that declines in residential investment are a good predictor of economic recessions.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We analyse the evolution and main drivers of residential investment, using a panel with quarterly data for 15 advanced economies since the 1970s. Residential investment is a notably volatile component of real GDP in all countries in the sample. We find real house price growth, net migration inflows and the size of the existing housing stock to be significant drivers of residential investment across various model specifications. We also detect important asymmetries: interest rate increases affect residential investment more than interest rate cuts, and interest rate changes have larger effects on residential investment when its share in overall GDP is rising. Finally, we show that adding information on residential investment significantly improves the performance of standard recession prediction models.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>There is growing interest in the causes and consequences of oil price changes. Various economic factors drive oil prices. Changing oil prices can affect the economy in different ways, depending on the factors driving the change. A better understanding of these drivers would help policymakers decide on the appropriate response to changing economic conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We propose a new method to identify the factors driving changes in oil prices. In particular, we focus on expectations for oil supply and demand. We quantify how much the revisions of these respective expectations contributed to oil prices and to economic activity.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Expectations for oil supply and demand explain about 30-35% of oil price changes. We find that an expected increase in supply initially reduces oil prices, slowing global economic activity. In the long run, however, increases in supply boost global economic activity. Similarly, an upward revision to expected demand for oil raises oil prices. Our results also show that financial factors and shale-oil technology are additional drivers of oil price fluctuations.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper proposes a simple but comprehensive structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model to examine the underlying factors of oil price dynamics. The distinguishing feature is to explicitly assess the role of expectations on future aggregate demand and oil supply in addition to the traditional realized aggregate demand and supply factors. Our empirical analysis shows that identified future demand and supply shocks explain about 30-35 percent of historical oil price fluctuations. In particular, future oil supply shocks are more than twice as important as realized and future demand shocks in accounting for oil price developments. The empirical result indicates that the influence of oil price shocks on global output varies according to the nature of each shock. We also show that the financial factors and the development of shale-oil technology are additional relevant sources of oil price fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The broad question is whether financial inclusion adds to financial instability. Here we focus on the narrow question of whether in the face of shocks, the small deposits of newly included households are likely to contribute to bank runs in the face of the closure of another bank nearby.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The literature on financial inclusion has tended to focus on the risks to a bank of lending to the smallest borrowers, while relying on imprecise aggregate data at the country level. In this paper, we focus on contagion risk with the advantage of granular bank deposit data at the town level. Our dataset allows us to distinguish deposits of different account sizes, including those sizes that are associated with financial inclusion. We are thus able to conduct careful event studies of the behaviour of these deposits around the closures of three different large banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In each of the three events we look at, we find no clear difference between the behavior of small depositors and that of large depositors. When a large bank is closed, we observe no significant withdrawals at other banks nearby by either small depositors or large ones. For two of the events, we do find some evidence that depositors, both large and small, anticipate that their bank is about to fail, and they start to withdraw before the bank is closed. This similarity of behavior suggests that financial inclusion is not likely to add to financial instability.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>How susceptible to contagion are bank deposits associated with financial inclusion? To shed light on this question, we analyze the behavior of deposits of different account sizes around three significant bank closures in the Philippines. When we look at the three events by applying difference-in-difference regressions to a dataset that distinguishes between small and large deposits at the town level, we find no evidence that the closure of a large bank leads to withdrawals by depositors at other banks nearby, whether the depositors are large or small. For two of the events, we do find some evidence that depositors, both large and small, anticipate that their bank is about to fail, and they start to withdraw before the bank is closed. With more comprehensive branch-level data for one of the events, we find that a bank closure does lead to reduced deposits at bank branches nearby. All this suggests that, while a bank failure can lead to contagion, the behavior of small depositors is no different from that of large depositors, and thus financial inclusion is unlikely to add to financial instability.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Banks, especially global ones, play critical roles in the transmission of monetary policies domestically and internationally. This was particularly true during the global financial crisis. This paper looks at how the adoption of unconventional monetary policies in the United States and the euro area influenced bankers' attitudes toward lending, and the implications for the international transmission of monetary policy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper pulls together a set of underused surveys of bankers' attitudes about lending conditions - surveys conducted with Senior Loan Officers from 16 countries - to offer new insights into the monetary transmission mechanism. We document the link between changing bank lending standards and changing domestic credit conditions. We show how changing lending attitudes in the major advanced economies led to spillovers of financial conditions to other advanced and emerging market economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Unconventional monetary policies resulted in a welcome lowering of bank lending standards and an increase in the supply of credit. This helped amplify the initial impacts of the central bank stimulus both at home and abroad. However, we also find evidence of a stigma effect. Resorting to unconventional monetary policies signalled a deterioration in economic prospects, which contributed to a decline in credit demand. This in turn sapped the policies' overall effectiveness. The experiences in the United States and euro area underscore the importance of effective central bank communication.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper argues that a measure of lending conditions - Senior Loan Officer (SLO) surveys - offers important insights into the monetary transmission mechanism. Using a Global VAR (GVAR) and SLO survey data from 16 countries, we document bank lending standards' significant role in explaining the dynamics of domestic credit conditions. Changes in lending attitudes lead to spillovers of financial conditions to other advanced and emerging market economies. We also examine the interaction of unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) and lending attitudes by using an external high frequency instrument. Looking through this lens of UMPs, we see that expansionary monetary policy led to a lowering of domestic credit standards which amplified the impact of the initial monetary stimulus. However, we also find evidence that the need to resort to UMPs also brought about a decline in lending demand, raising questions about whether the signaling channel of monetary policy unintentionally worked at cross purposes by sapping the full effectiveness of these policies. The varied experiences in the United States and euro area draw attention to the relative importance of bank intermediation in determining the strength of the bank lending channel of monetary policy.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Inflation puzzles academics and policymakers. Its lengthy cycles are hard to reconcile with conventional theories. Recently, several senior policymakers have suggested that population trends might explain these cycles. We study this potential link.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper is the first to look at the potential link between the population's age structure and inflation, taking a very long-term view. Our data go back to 1870 and cover 22 countries. We find a strong relationship that potentially calls into question conventional monetary theories. The link could also have direct policy implications. It could raise the question of how persistent inflation really is. It could improve inflation forecasting. And it could explain how long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored in spite of low inflation at present.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find a link between a population's age structure and inflation. A larger share of young and old in the population is associated with higher inflation. Conversely, a larger share of working age people is associated with lower inflation. The finding is statistically significant. It is present in different time periods, including the last few decades, and when different measurement methods are used. The finding is also economically significant. For instance, in the United States a high share of dependants in the population raised yearly inflation by around 7 percentage points between the 1950s and 1970s. And a higher share of working age people brought inflation back down, by around 7 percentage points, between the 1970s and the 2000s.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Demographic shifts, such as population ageing, have been suggested as possible explanations for the past decade's low inflation. We exploit cross-country variation in a long panel to identify age structure effects in inflation, controlling for standard monetary factors. A robust relationship emerges that accords with the lifecycle hypothesis. That is, inflationary pressure rises when the share of dependants increases and, conversely, subsides when the share of working age population increases. This relationship accounts for the bulk of trend inflation, for instance, about 7 percentage points of US disinflation since the 1980s. It predicts rising inflation over the coming decades.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>After the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-09, central banks in several advanced economies, including the ECB, made large-scale asset purchases in order to reduce long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy. Following the euro area sovereign debt crisis of 2010-11, financial stability measures were introduced in Europe in order to help preserve financial stability. In this paper, we ask how effective these unconventional monetary policy and financial stability measures have been in reducing the term premia, which also reflect credit risk and liquidity risk, of long-term government bonds in different euro area countries.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>One contribution of our paper is to study the announcement effects of the ECB's asset purchase programmes since 2009 on government bond term premia for a wide range of euro area countries, using novel term premia estimates from term structure models by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research at the daily frequency. Another contribution of our paper is to study the effects of the announcements of important financial stability measures in the euro area on government bond term premia in 11 euro area countries.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the term premia of Belgium, Ireland, Italy and Spain fell significantly in response to the announcements of the ECB's asset purchases and of financial stability measures in the euro area, by between 6 and 49 basis points on average per announcement. By contrast, the term premia of Germany increased in response to the announcements of asset purchases and financial stability measures, by around 5 basis points on average per announcement. This increase in the term premia of German government bonds could be due partly to some reversal of a flight to quality into German government bonds following the announcements.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the effects of the announcements of ECB asset purchases and of financial stability measures in the euro area on ten-year government bond term premia in eleven euro area countries in the wake of the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis. We find that the term premia of euro area countries with higher sovereign risk, as measured by sovereign CDS spreads, decreased more in response to the announcements of asset purchases and financial stability measures. Term premia of countries with the lowest sovereign risk either increased as in Germany, or were not significantly affected or fell slightly, as in the Netherlands and Finland.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Prior to the 2007-09 Great Financial Crisis, an inflation target of 2% was viewed as high enough to make the effective lower bound (ELB) constraint on nominal interest rates largely irrelevant. This view is now questioned in the light of two important developments. First, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the ELB proved to be a more persistent and severe constraint than anticipated. Second, the real neutral rate has fallen, implying lower nominal interest rates and less scope for conventional monetary policy easing in response to shocks, given the 2% target. Motivated by these developments, we study the extent to which raising the inflation target to 3% or 4% could improve macroeconomic stability in Canada.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>First, we consider different assumptions about the level of the real neutral rate. Second, we take into account the possibility that the central bank can make systematic, rule-based use of the two most prevalent types of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) at the ELB: forward guidance and quantitative easing. Third, our analysis is carried out in the Bank of Canada's main policy model, which provides a quantitatively realistic description of the Canadian economy.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that when the real neutral rate is positive, UMP essentially eliminates most gains of raising the inflation target to 3% or 4%. On the other hand, if the real neutral rate is negative, an increase in the inflation target provides substantial macroeconomic benefits by reducing the impact of the ELB on the output gap and inflation, regardless of the availability or effectiveness of UMP. We also find that forward guidance is more powerful when the real neutral rate is sufficiently high, while quantitative easing becomes more effective if the real neutral rate is negative.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Recent international experience with the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates has rekindled interest in the benefits of inflation targets above 2 per cent. We evaluate whether an increase in the inflation target to 3 or 4 per cent could improve macroeconomic stability in the Canadian economy. We find that the magnitude of the benefits hinges critically on two elements: (i) the availability and effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) tools at the effective lower bound, and, (ii) the level of the real neutral interest rate. In particular, we show that when the real neutral rate is in line with the central tendency of estimates, raising the inflation target yields some improvement in macroeconomic outcomes. There are only modest gains if effective UMP tools are available. In contrast, with a deeply negative real neutral rate, a higher inflation target substantially improves macroeconomic stability regardless of UMP.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Monetary policy spillovers from advanced economies into international asset markets have received renewed attention in the post-crisis period. This paper estimates the impact of US monetary policy shocks into international bond yields in a broad sample of developed and emerging market economies, and provides evidence with a view to uncovering the underlying transmission mechanisms involved.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We identify US monetary policy shocks through short-term interest movements around FOMC meetings. To trace the underlying spillover mechanisms into international long-term bond yields, we apply an affine term-structure decomposition to separate the effects into movements in expected short-term rates (the risk-neutral component) and term premia. We also provide evidence on exchange rate fluctuations and fixed-income fund flows to help identify the transmission channels.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>US monetary policy shocks are large, especially in the post-crisis period, where a 100 bp US shock after a FOMC meeting has increased international long-term yields by about 50 bp. This is economically important, and at least as large as the impact of domestic monetary policy actions. Moreover, spillovers work through different mechanisms. They are concentrated in risk-neutral rates (expectations of future policy rates) for developed countries, but predominantly on term premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these findings, we provide evidence consistent with an exchange rate channel, according to which foreign central banks face a trade-off between narrowing policy rate differentials, and experiencing currency movements. Developed countries adjust in a manner consistent with freely floating regimes, responding partially with risk-neutral rates (expectations of future policy rates), and partially through currency adjustments. By contrast, emerging market economies display patterns consistent with FX interventions, which cushion the response of exchange rates but reinforce capital flows and their effects in bond yields through movements in term premia. Our results suggest that the endogenous effects of currency interventions on long-term yields should be added into the standard cost-benefit analysis of such policies.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We document significant US monetary policy (MP) spillovers to international bond markets. Our methodology identifies US MP shocks as the change in short-term treasury yields within a narrow window around FOMC meetings, and traces their effects on international bond yields using panel regressions. We emphasize three main results. First, US MP spillovers to long-term yields have increased substantially after the global financial crisis. Second, spillovers are large compared to the effects of other events, and at least as large as the effects of domestic MP after 2008. Third, spillovers work through different channels, concentrated in risk neutral rates (expectations of future MP rates) for developed countries, but predominantly on term premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these findings, we provide evidence consistent with an <em>exchange rate channel</em>, according to which foreign central banks face a tradeoff between narrowing MP rate differentials, or experiencing currency movements against the US dollar. Developed countries adjust in a manner consistent with freely floating regimes, responding partially with risk neutral rates, and partially through currency adjustments. Emerging countries display patterns consistent with FX interventions, which cushion the response of exchange rates but reinforce capital flows and their effects in bond yields through movements in term premia. Our results suggest that the endogenous effects of FXI on long-term yields should be added into the standard cost-benefit analysis of such policies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How can financial constraints affect the exchange rate? We propose a theoretical model to address this question, using high-frequency data on Colombian banks to test its predictions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a simple theoretical model to analytically evaluate the impact of banking limits on the equilibrium exchange rate. We thereby characterise the portfolio balance channel. We then use high-frequency data from Colombian banks to empirically test the model's predictions. Our data cover every financial institution in the 2004-15 period, and various measures of portfolio balances. We also use data on official foreign exchange intervention that let us analyse the effect of banking portfolio holdings, and to address whether foreign exchange intervention is an effective monetary tool, and under what conditions. Finally, our identifying strategy is based on the way that regulatory authorities imposed banking limits on foreign holdings. Intuitively, a break in the policy measure creates a natural experiment in which financial institutions arbitrarily face binding constraints as long as they are close to the required limit.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The decision to hold domestic or foreign assets is relevant depending on whether financial constraints are binding. In the case where constraints bind, portfolio compositions affect the equilibrium exchange rate and foreign exchange interventions are effective. This is not the case when constraints are not binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, in the empirical application we find that effects of financial restrictions on the exchange rate are short-lived, and significant only when banking limits bind. Moreover, we find significant effects on portfolio balances when banks are faced with binding constraints. Finally, we find that exchange rate effects are larger in episodes when Colombia's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper we analyze the effects of financial constraints on the exchange rate through the portfolio balance channel. Our contribution is twofold: First, we construct a tractable two-period general equilibrium model in which financial constraints inhibit capital flows. Hence, departures from the uncovered interest rate parity condition are used to explain the effects of sterilized foreign exchange intervention. Second, using high frequency data during 2004-2015, we use a sharp policy discontinuity within Colombian regulatory banking limits to empirically test for the portfolio balance channel. Consistent with our model's postulations, our findings suggest that the effects on the exchange rate are short-lived, and significant only when banking constraints are binding.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Should central banks in emerging markets take systemic risk into account when making monetary policy decisions? We study the issue by allowing for financial risk in the standard open economy model used by policymakers around the world.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 has highlighted the need for policymakers to address financial risk concerns. Some commentators suggest that central banks should take account of financial risk in setting the policy rate. In particular, they propose "leaning against the wind", by which central banks should raise interest rates when financial imbalances accumulate. However, research on "leaning against the wind" has concentrated on the experience of advanced economies. Little is known about the advisability of such policies in emerging markets, where capital flows are important contributors to financial imbalances.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We study the issue in the open economy framework used by central banks around the world and calibrate it for Mexico. We find that, in emerging markets, "leaning against the wind" considerations for conducting monetary policy are weakened. In fact, higher interest rates attract additional capital flows, which in turn fuel domestic credit growth and the accumulation of financial imbalances.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The Global Financial Crisis opened a heated debate on whether inflation target regimes must be relaxed and allow for monetary policy to address financial stability concerns. Nonetheless, this debate has focused on the ability of the interest rate to "lean against the wind" and, more generally, on the accumulation of systemic risk arising from the macro-financial challenges faced by advanced economies. This paper extends the debate to emerging markets by developing micro-foundations that allow extending a simplified version of the New-Keynesian credit augmented model of Curdia and Woodford (2016) to a small-open economy scenario, and by subsequently using the same empirical strategy as Ajello et al. (2015) to calibrate the model for Mexico. The results suggest that openness in the capital account, and in particular a strong dependence of domestic financial conditions on capital flows, diminishes the effectiveness of monetary policy to lean against the wind. Indeed, in the open-economy with endogenous financial crises, the optimal policy rate is even below the level that would prevail in the absence of endogenous financial crisis and systemic risk.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper tests whether the linkages between financial and macroeconomic variables are similar in the economies that have the same degree of liquidity dependence (i.e. the same share of industries that are sensitive to the availability of funding from external sources).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>There is ample literature on the link between the macroeconomic developments in times of financial stress and the economies' industrial composition. We contribute to this strand of research in several ways. Firstly, we compile a dataset of industry-level liquidity dependence indicators that are directly measured and cover all economic activities (not just manufacturing). Secondly, we employ a more general (and arguably more practical) econometric approach that does not limit our study to an analysis of one-off events (e.g. financial crises or recessions).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that the differences in the linkage between financial and macroeconomic variables across seven European economies are associated with the degree of their liquidity dependence. In fact, by incorporating this feature into a formal econometric model it is possible to improve its forecasting accuracy (as compared with the performance of the linear country-specific models). We interpret this result as an indication of importance of an economy's liquidity dependence in the determination of linkages between real and financial variables.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We estimate a panel Bayesian vector autoregression model for a cross-section of seven advanced European economies and produce out-of-sample forecasts of GDP conditionally on observed developments of interest rates and credit. We show that, by using a smooth transition version of the model and allowing the parameters to vary across economies conditionally on their liquidity dependence (i.e. dependence on the availability of funding from external sources), it is possible to improve the accuracy of the forecasts. We conclude that the degree of liquidity dependence is likely to be among the important predictors of heterogeneity in macro-financial linkages across countries.</p>

<h3 class="video">Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Over the last decade, nominal interest rates have fallen to very low levels in many countries. Thus, central banks have seen their choices for the appropriate path of policy rates constrained by an effective lower bound, a level below which nominal interest rates cannot fall. Nevertheless, traditional forecasting models neglect this lower boundary, which is equivalent to assuming central banks could steer interest rates as low as they like. But acknowledging the lower bound should evidently matter when forecasting the path of interest rates and for understanding economic responses to policy changes.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We incorporate the lower bound into an otherwise standard econometric model of interest rates and macroeconomic variables. Our model tracks a "shadow rate", which is a hypothetical rate identical to the actual nominal rate except when rates hit the lower bound. In this case, the shadow rate moves below the lower bound. We apply this model to US data. Since US policymakers chose not to move the target range for the policy rate below zero, we take the level of the lower bound to be known. (In other economies, policy rates have been cut below zero, so that the exact depth of the lower bound remains a question for further research.)</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our model generates near-term forecasts for nominal interest rates that compare well with others. Moreover, we also produce forecasts for the longer-run level of the real rate, sometimes known as the "neutral rate". Our estimates of the longer-run level of the real rate have edged down somewhat in recent decades, but not by quite as much as other estimates. Compared with other models, our approach largely sees through the extraordinary depth of the last recession. Our results suggest that real rates can be expected to move back up, approaching the levels seen before.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Modeling nominal interest rates requires their effective lower bound (ELB) to be taken into account. We propose a flexible time series approach that includes a "shadow rate" - a notional rate identical to the actual nominal rate except when the ELB binds. We apply this approach to a trend-cycle decomposition of interest rates and macroeconomic variables that generates competitive interest-rate forecasts. Our estimates of the real-rate trend have edged down somewhat in recent decades, but not significantly so. We identify monetary policy shocks from shadow-rate surprises and find that they were particularly effective at stimulating economic activity during the ELB period.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Understanding how monetary policy works in China is important in the context of its growing weight in the global economy. We examine whether China's gradual transition to a market economy in the past decade and recent monetary policy reforms have made any difference to the role of interest rates in the transmission of monetary policy.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our main contribution is to construct a time series of monetary policy surprises using daily changes in interest rates during short windows around policy decisions and communications by the People's Bank of China. We focus on movements in one-year interest rate swap contracts based on the interbank seven-day repo rate to measure market expectations of monetary policy. Using these estimates, we see how the term structure of interest rates reacts to monetary policy surprises. We then identify monetary policy shocks and quantify their impact on output and inflation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that monetary policy shocks tend to have persistent effects on long-term bond yields, corporate bond spreads and aggregate bank deposits and loans. This indicates that there is an interest rate channel of monetary policy in China. Further, we find that a contractionary monetary policy shock has persistent macroeconomic effects and is followed by lower inflation and slower industrial production growth. Our findings provide support to recent studies suggesting that monetary policy transmission in China has become increasingly similar to that in advanced economies.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We explore the role of interest rates in monetary policy transmission in China in the context of its multiple instrument setting. In doing so, we construct a new series of monetary policy surprises using information from high frequency Chinese finan- cial market data around major monetary policy announcements. Our event analysis shows that monetary policy surprises have persistent effects on interest rates. We then use these surprise measures as external instruments to identify monetary pol- icy shocks in an SVAR. We find that a contractionary monetary policy surprise increases interest rates and significantly reduces inflation and economic activity. Our findings provide further support to recent studies suggesting that monetary policy transmission in China has become increasingly similar to that in advanced economies.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Inflation-targeting central banks regularly point to surveys of inflation expectations as indicators of future price pressures, and a guide for the direction of policy. Indeed, previous research has shown that surveys predict inflation well.  However, even professional forecasters have been shown to make predictable errors. In particular, prior research suggests that survey respondents do not always fully update their predictions in light of incoming data: survey forecasts of inflation have been found to be "sticky". But, so far it has been unclear whether stickiness is a given feature of survey forecasts, or whether it could be related to the predictability of inflation and the monetary regime more generally.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We combine a model of inflation with a model of sticky survey forecasts. The key innovation of our model is to estimate changes of stickiness together with changes in the predictability of inflation over time. In the model, the survey forecast is a weighted average of last period's survey forecast and an optimal forecast. We generate optimal forecasts from a model known to be successful at forecasting inflation from prior research. We measure "stickiness" by the weight that the average survey respondent puts on past forecasts rather than the optimal forecast.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We estimate our model from data on U.S. inflation, since the late 1960s, and forecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters. While surveys may have become stickier in recent decades, our results suggest that survey respondents continue to pay attention to changes in trend inflation. Prior to the mid-1980s, also known as the "Great Inflation" period, shocks to inflation had long-lasting effects on future inflation. For this period, we find that survey responses tracked optimal forecasts quite closely. Surveys have become sticky only since the late 1990s, when shocks to inflation were much more short-lived and trend inflation had stabilized.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper studies the joint dynamics of real-time U.S. inflation and average inflation predictions of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) based on sample ranging from 1968Q4 to 2017Q2. The joint data generating process (DGP) comprises an unobserved components (UC) model of inflation and a sticky information (SI) prediction mechanism for the SPF predictions. We add drifting gap inflation persistence to a UC model in which stochastic volatility (SV) affects trend and gap inflation. Another innovation puts a time-varying frequency of inflation forecast updating into the SI prediction mechanism. The joint DGP is a nonlinear state space model (SSM). We estimate the SSM using Bayesian tools grounded in a Rao-Blackwellized auxiliary particle filter, particle learning, and a particle smoother. The estimates show that (i) longer horizon average SPF inflation predictions inform estimates of trend inflation; (ii) gap inflation persistence is procyclical and SI inflation updating is frequent before the Volcker disinflation; and (iii) subsequently, gap inflation persistence turns countercyclical and SI inflation updating becomes infrequent.</p>

<h3 class="video">Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We ask which firms borrow in international bond markets when global investors favour risky debt. Previous research suggests that international bond issuance increases when investors' risk appetite is high. We believe this effect could be stronger for firms that benefit more from the search for yield. In addition, we seek to understand what the risks might be for domestic economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We test if firms with a higher credit risk borrow more internationally when global risk appetite is high. This might occur, given that international investors charge such companies a higher credit spread, so that their funding costs will depend heavily on investors' risk appetite. To explore the issue we use micro-level data, combining firms' financial statements with bond-level data. Our data set covers a large sample of firms based in small open economies, and the period 2000-15.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that smaller, younger and less well known firms do borrow more from global investors when risk appetite is high. In addition, we show that, after three years, the additional funding increases debt levels. Our findings suggest how global financial conditions can affect local economies through risky firms and, more generally, that it is important to understand firm-level features when analysing cross-border flows of capital.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate the role of firms' credit risk in the onshore transmission of international bond market conditions. We show that reductions in the global price of risk, measured by the excess bond premium, encourage more international bond borrowing by smaller and younger firms. Due to informational asymmetries, these firms pay a higher credit spread. Thus their funding costs, and consequently their international borrowing, are more tightly linked to the global price of risk. The funds borrowed in response to favourable market conditions cause their balance sheets to deteriorate; over a three-year horizon, leverage increases, in support of capital expenditure, and cash holdings increase. Our results reveal a micro-level link between rising global risk appetite and the gradual build-up of domestic vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3 class="video">Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We look at how and why changes in bank credit supply affect firm productivity. In particular, we study whether supply driven contractions in bank credit, such as those incurred by firms during the Great Recession (GR), impairs their ability to earn revenues for a given amount of accumulated inputs (by affecting their productivity enhancing activities).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Several research papers have shown that credit supply helps firms purchase inputs, most notably capital, thus allowing them to increase production. This paper extends this research by showing that credit affects firm productivity beyond the estimated scale effect.</p>
<p>We do so by exploiting a matched firm-bank database for a large sample of Italian firms over the period 1997-2013. This allows us to identify idiosyncratic supply-side shocks to firm credit availability. We exploit detailed balance sheet data and information from several surveys to identify firms' productivity and trace it back to a large set of firm-level activities. We also focus on the GR, exploiting the shock to credit supply induced by the freeze of the interbank market in 2007-08.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that credit contractions have a negative and persistent effect on firm productivity. The credit contraction observed during the GR could account for about a quarter of the observed decline in Italian productivity. Positive credit supply shocks have a much more limited positive impact, implying that credit volatility may be bad for productivity growth. The estimated impact is found to result from several productivity enhancing activities. These include R&amp;D, patenting, adoption of IT, improved management practices and propensity to export.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We study the impact of bank credit supply on firm output and productivity. By exploiting a matched firm-bank database which covers all the credit relationships of Italian corporations over more than a decade, we measure idiosyncratic supply-side shocks to firms' credit availability. We use our data to estimate a production model augmented with financial frictions and show that an expansion in credit supply leads firms to increase both their inputs and their output (value added and revenues) for a given level of inputs. Our estimates imply that a credit crunch will be followed by a productivity slowdown, as experienced by most OECD countries after the Great Recession. Quantitatively, the credit contraction between 2007 and 2009 could account for about a quarter of the observed decline in Italy's total factor productivity growth. The results are robust to an alternative measurement of credit supply shocks that uses the 2007-08 interbank market freeze as a natural experiment to control for assortative matching between borrowers and lenders.

<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We ask whether firms take on more debt when their local currency appreciates against the US dollar and financial frictions are relaxed on the firm side. To answer this question, we use firm-level data from the ORBIS database on listed and non-listed firms in ten major Asian emerging market economies over the period of 2002 to 2015.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper is the first in the literature that provides direct evidence at the firm level on the risk-taking channel of currency appreciation by looking at <em>all</em> firms' foreign currency (FX) exposure. Since the ORBIS database does not break down firm-level debt by currency, we use BIS data on country-level FX loans and bonds and on total credit to calculate the country-level FX debt share. Then we apply this share to firms' total debt and obtain firm-level measures of FX debt.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that, when faced with local currency appreciation against the US dollar, firms with larger FX debt before the exchange rate appreciates, increase their leverage more than those with smaller FX debt after the appreciation. Such effects are stronger for firms in the non-tradable sector than those in the tradable sector.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We test the risk taking channel of exchange rate appreciations using firm-level data from private and public firms in ten Asian emerging market economies during 2002-2015. Since foreign currency (FX) debt at the firm level is not observed for the Asian economies, we approximate the FX debt of a given firm by assuming that any given firm will hold a constant share of its total debt in foreign currency, where this share is given by the firm's country's share of FX liabilities in total liabilities. We measure risk taking by firm leverage. We show that firms with a higher volume of FX debt before the exchange rate appreciates, increase their leverage relatively more after the appreciation. Our results imply that more indebted firms become even more leveraged after exchange rate appreciations.</p>

<h3 class="video">Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper investigates whether the credit risk of sovereign debt differs depending on whether or not it is issued in the countries' own currency. It also asks if the gap between local and foreign currency sovereign risk has changed over time and, if so, what the drivers might be.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Analysts routinely assume sovereign debt is safer when issued in the borrowing country's local currency rather than a foreign currency. However, few have studied this risk gap systematically and the literature offers little guidance about why such a gap should exist. We document both the existence of a gap and the fact that it has steadily diminished over the past two decades. We then examine five hypotheses for how the gap might be related to observable factors. We are the first to propose and test these hypotheses.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We document that sovereign risk tends to be less when bonds are issued in local rather than foreign currency, but that the gap has narrowed considerably over time. We find that the gap narrows when foreign exchange reserves are higher, foreign borrowing is lower, banks hold more government debt, and global volatility is less. At the same time, we find no support for the view that debt in local currency is safer because of sovereigns' willingness to inflate away their local debt.</p>
<p>The main reason for the trend decline in the gap is the surge in foreign exchange reserves, which makes foreign currency debt less risky. Additional reasons are that governments depend less than before on borrowing in foreign currency overseas, and that global volatility has declined. The risk gap between local and foreign currency sovereign debt might widen again if reserves and the ability to borrow in local currency diminished, while global volatility increased.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Historically, sovereign debt in local currency has been considered safer than debt in foreign currency. Yet the literature offers scant theoretical or empirical guidance as to why such a gap exists, or why it appears to have slowly and steadily diminished for all regions over the past two decades, as expressed in the ratings widely used by global investors and regulators to assess credit risk. We suggest and empirically test five hypotheses. We find that differences in inflation do not explain the assessed gaps between local and foreign currency credit risk. The banking sector's vulnerability to sovereign debt problems is a significant determinant of the spread, but does not account for its decline over time. Instead, the surge in global reserves, and to lesser extent the reduced reliance on overseas foreign currency borrowing (ie the decline of original sin), as well as lower global volatility, appear to have lessened the gap. But if these variables were to go into reverse, the gap could again widen.</p>

<h3 class="video">Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>US dollar funding is the lifeblood of international banking. Non-US global banks have a very large footprint in dollar banking despite their restricted access to core dollar deposits and central bank backstops. They collectively held $12.6 trillion of dollar-denominated assets by the end of 2017 – rivalling those of US banks. Wholesale dollar funding markets, in which global banks source dollars, were at the forefront during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. Both crises – together with subsequent regulatory reforms – have changed the structure and functioning of these markets.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We show that pricing in the very deep and liquid market where global banks source their dollar funding is far from competitive. We use a detailed data set of US money market fund (MMF) holdings of secured and unsecured instruments issued by these banks. The richness of our data set allows us to study underlying market frictions and identify their effects on prices. Our identification strategy is based on exogenous market disruptions during otherwise tranquil periods, which helps us to avoid the impact of confounding factors usually present during a crisis.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We document persistent and significant price dislocations in these wholesale dollar funding markets. The markets for both repos and unsecured instruments are highly concentrated, with the top five US MMF fund families taking around 60% of the respective market shares. We establish the key role of bargaining frictions arising from the over-the-counter nature of these markets. To establish the causal effect of bargaining power on prices, we devise an identification strategy that utilises external shocks on both the funding supply (MMFs) and demand (banks) sides, in both secured and unsecured instruments. Disruptions in these markets can spill over to other key dollar funding markets such as foreign exchange (FX) swaps.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We document significant and persistent price dislocations in secured and unsecured wholesale dollar funding markets between US money market funds (MMFs) and highly-rated global banks. We show that bargaining frictions affect prices in these key short-term dollar funding markets. Our identification strategy relies on a number of quasi-experiments, including the US MMF reform and quarter-end window-dressing by European banks.  Post-crisis regulations have reduced competition in these markets and have generated incentives for regulatory arbitrage, which affect bargaining power and prices. Our results also highlight substantial heterogeneity across global banks of different nationalities in their behavior in dollar funding markets.</p>

<h3 class="video">Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper explores whether the accumulation of net foreign assets (NFAs) feed into larger external imbalances. This is done by analysing the impact of external positions on the current account for a panel of 39 economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The analysis of external imbalances usually focuses on the current account (a flow). In this paper, we stress the role of net foreign assets (a stock). A priori, larger NFA positions would widen current account imbalances and feed into even larger NFA positions. So, stock imbalances are expected to be destabilising and this would entail that global imbalances would be harder to rein in.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>For creditor countries, stock imbalances are indeed destabilising: the accumulation of external wealth feeds into larger current account surpluses. On the contrary, for debtor countries external debt is stabilising as it limits current account deficits. The income balance, which conveys the returns on external assets and liabilities, widen the imbalances in both groups of countries, as expected. But the trade balance reacts differently for creditors and for debtors. External wealth accumulation in creditor countries fails to increase consumption or imports. Thus, creditors do not reduce the trade balance surpluses as NFAs increase. For debtor countries, the accumulation of external debt reduces imports and consumption. As a result, the trade balance improves. This improvement more than offsets the current account deterioration induced by the income balance. That is why stock imbalances in debtor countries are stabilising. The asymmetry between debtor and creditors has implications for the adjustment dynamics in the global economy.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>After the recent crisis, a reduction was observed in global current account (flow imbalances). Still, global disequilibria as measured in terms of countries' net foreign assets (stock imbalances), kept increasing. This paper studies whether stock imbalances have a stabilizing or destabilizing impact on countries' accumulation of external wealth and why. Our results show that in debtor economies the existing stock of net debt is stabilising as it helps to reduce trade imbalances, limit current account deficits and halt future debt accumulation. In creditor countries, instead, the positive stock of net foreign assets contributes - everything else equal - to increase future current account surpluses, as trade balances do not adjust, potentially leading to destabilizing dynamics in wealth accumulation. The asymmetry may have relevant implications for global trade and growth.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Since well before the Great Financial Crisis, monetary policy has been grappling with two major forces. On the one hand, the inflation process has proved rather insensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, financial cycles have become larger and more disruptive. This has made it much harder for policy to reconcile price stability with financial, and hence macroeconomic, stability. For instance, easy monetary policy designed to bring a stubborn inflation rate back to target can fuel financial booms and heighten economic risks down the road. The current analytical paradigm underplays the interaction of these two deep-seated forces.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We explore the interaction of these two forces and their policy implications. To do so, we bring together recent research. We question the usefulness of the natural interest rate as a monetary policy benchmark. We present empirical evidence on the determination of the real interest rate that supports this conclusion. We then lay out a framework that assigns monetary policy a greater role in mitigating the financial cycle as part of a multi-pronged approach.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The financial cycle has a large and persistent impact on the economy, including by misallocating resources. Monetary policy regimes appear to influence long-term movements in <em>real</em> interest rates more than saving and investment. That influence operates in part through the long-lasting scars that financial cycles leave on the economy. A more balanced monetary policy framework would place less emphasis on near-term inflation and more on the financial cycle.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Monetary policy has been in the grip of a pincer movement, caught between growing financial cycles, on the one hand, and an inflation process that has become quite insensitive to domestic slack, on the other. This two-pronged attack has laid bare some of the limitations of prevailing monetary policy frameworks, particularly in the analytical notions that have guided much of its practice. We argue that the natural rate of interest as a guidepost for monetary policy has a couple of limitations: the concept, as traditionally conceived, neglects the state of the financial cycle in the definition of equilibrium; in addition, it underestimates the role that monetary policy regimes may play in persistent real interest rate movements. These limitations may expose monetary policy to blindsiding by the collateral damage that comes from an unhinged financial cycle. We propose a more balanced approach that recognises the difficulties monetary policy has in fine-tuning inflation and responds more systematically to the financial cycle.</p>

<h3><strong>Focus</strong></h3>
<p>This paper examines the reasons for the persistent negative 30-year swap spread. Because of the credit risk implicit in Libor, swap rates should exceed the (theoretical) risk-free rate and rise when bank credit risk increases. Further, Treasuries (against which swap spreads are computed) are "safe haven" assets whose yields fall during a crisis, so that they trade at a liquidity premium. On this basis, the 30-year swap spread should have increased after the Lehman default. Yet, instead, it declined into negative territory. This we seek to explain.</p>
<h3><strong>Contribution </strong></h3>
<p>In our model, underfunded pension plans' demand for duration hedging leads them to optimally receive the fixed rate in long-maturity swaps. They can balance their asset-liability duration by investing in long-term bonds or by receiving fixed interest via an interest rate swap with long maturity. We predict that, if pension funds are underfunded, they prefer to hedge their duration risk with swaps rather than buying Treasuries. The preference for swaps arises because these require only modest investment to cover margins, whereas buying a government bond requires outright investment. Such demand, coupled with dealer balance sheet constraints, results in negative swap spreads. To test our model, we also construct an empirical measure of the aggregate underfunded status of pension plans in Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>Findings</strong></h3>
<p>Our evidence suggests that the swap spreads tend to be negative when pension plans are underfunded. Using our measure of the aggregate funding status of US defined benefit (DB) pension plans (both private and public), we test the relationship between the underfunded ratio (UFR) of DB plans and long-term swap spreads in a regression setting. Even after controlling for other common drivers of swap spreads, we find that the UFR is a significant variable in explaining 30-year swap spreads. We also show that swap spreads for shorter maturities are unaffected by changes in the UFR.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The 30-year U.S. swap spreads have been negative since September 2008. We offer a novel explanation for this persistent anomaly. Through an illustrative model, we show that underfunded pension plans optimally use swaps for duration hedging. Combined with dealer banks' balance sheet constraints, this demand can drive swap spreads to become negative. Empirically, we construct a measure of the aggregate funding status of Defined Benefit pension plans and show that this measure is a significant explanatory variable of 30-year swap spreads. We find a similar link between pension funds' underfunding and swap spreads for two other regions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper looks at whether the information value of credit rating agency announcements relating to sovereign bonds has diminished since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-09. In particular, taking into account the prior credit status of the bonds, we measure how the response of credit default swap spreads (CDS) to such announcements has changed.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Rating agencies were sharply criticised for their credit risk assessments of certain derivative products in the run-up to the GFC and subsequently when certain European sovereign bonds were downgraded. This may have led investors to discount the information value of their assessments. We look at whether the response of CDS spreads to credit rating announcements - including rating changes, watch status and outlook status - have changed since the GFC.</p>
<p>Previous studies investigating the informational value of rating agencies' assessments have often obtained contradictory results. We show that this is partly attributable to a failure to adequately capture transitional states. In our measurement of the marginal informational value of agency announcements, we carefully control for the specific transition from one state, as designated by an agency, to another. For example, an announcement may signal a downgrade. But whether this transition is from a "stable", "negative watch" or "negative outlook" designation matters. Similar distinctions are also important for "watch" and "outlook" announcements.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Overall, we find that upgrades and downgrades from a stable/developing status exhibit the strongest market responses. By contrast, the responses are weakest when the bonds are already under watch. Following the GFC, announcements continued to have statistically significant impacts on CDS spreads, although such impacts were substantially less pronounced for most announcement categories. Weaker responses were especially noteworthy for credit downgrades transitioning from negative outlook states, and for negative outlook announcements transitioning from stable states.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This paper investigates whether the price response to credit rating agency (CRA) announcements on sovereign bonds has diminished since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). We characterize credit rating events more precisely than previous work, controlling agency announcements for the prior credit state - outlook, watch/review, or stable status as well as the level of the credit rating. Emphasizing the transition from one state to another allows us to distinguish between different types of announcement (rating changes, watch and outlook events) and their price effects. We employ an event study methodology and gauge market response by standardized cumulative abnormal returns (SCAR) and directional change statistics in daily credit default swap (CDS) spreads. We find that rating announcements provide a rich and varied set of information on how credit rating agencies in fluence market perceptions of sovereign default risk. CRA announcements continued to have significant effects on CDS spreads after the GFC, but the magnitude of the responses generally fell. Moreover, we find that accurate measurement of these effects depends on conditioning for the prior credit state of the sovereign bond.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates four times under zero since 2014. This paper extracts the market expectations embedded in the euro area's yield curve to study the impact of the ECB's negative rate policy on that yield curve.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Negative policy rates are a relatively new tool for central banks and it is important to understand their implications, particularly for financial markets, which are  important intermediaries in the transmission of monetary policy actions to the real economy.</p>
<p>This paper proposes a new model to extract the impact of negative interest rates on the yield curve which fits the data much better than alternative models. This new model introduces two latent state variables that capture the immediate and longer horizon monetary policy stances, respectively, in order to describe the rich dynamics playing out at the short end of the yield curve. These two policy indicators guide the time variations of the effective lower bound of interest rates which, in turn, govern the shape of the short end of the yield curve.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We use the model to extract the market's expectations of the ECB's negative interest rates from the yield curve. We find that the cuts in June 2014, when the ECB first moved into negative territory, and December 2015 were expected one month ahead. However, the September 2014 cut was unanticipated. Most interestingly, the March 2016 cut was expected four months ahead of time.</p>
<p>We then evaluate the impact of negative interest rates on the yield curve with a hypothetical analysis. We find that, if the central bank had committed to an expansionary policy in both the short and long run in June 2017, the two-year yield would have decreased by 0.2% and the long term yield by 0.16%.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We first calculate the "variance risk premiums" (VRPs) that investors require for taking on stock market volatility risk in major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) over 2007-15. We test whether the US and eurozone AEs' risk premiums affect those of other economies. We also examine the US premium's impact on equity fund flows to other economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses a parametric model to estimate the VRP in EME stock markets. We decompose the VRP into a part that compensates for the risk of continuous price changes and one that compensates for the risk of discontinuous price changes. We then investigate the cross-market correlations of the three premiums. Moreover, we consider equity fund flows as a possible path through which such premiums spill over globally.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find evidence of significant VRP spillovers from the United States and the eurozone AEs to other economies following the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09. Also, increases in the size of the US premium significantly reduce equity fund flows to all other AEs and some EMEs during the same period.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We estimate variance risk premiums (VRPs) in the stock markets of major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) over 2007-15 and decompose the VRP into variance-diffusive risk premium (DRP) and variance-jump risk premium (JRP). Daily VAR analysis reveals significant spillovers from the VRPs of the United States and eurozone's AEs to the VRPs of other economic areas, especially during the post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period. We also find that during the post-GFC period, shocks to the DRPs of the United States and the eurozone's AEs have relatively strong and long-lived positive effects on the VRPs of other economic areas whereas shocks to their JRPs have relatively weak and short-lived positive effects. In addition, we show that increases in the size of US VRP, DRP and JRP tend to significantly reduce weekly equity fund flows to all other AEs and some EMEs during the post-GFC period. Finally, US DRP plays a more important role than US JRP in the determination of equity fund flows to all other AEs and some EMEs after the GFC, while the opposite holds true for equity fund flows to all other AEs during the GFC. Such results indicate the possibility of equity fund flows working as a channel of cross-market VRP spillovers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the structure of the shadow banking system in China, focusing on the main activities and linkages with the formal banking sector. With the help of our newly developed shadow banking map, we analyse how shadow banking activities in China have evolved and how their dynamics have changed.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Existing research tends to focus on specific aspects of shadow banking in China. We take a broader look by developing a map of shadow banking that allows for a comprehensive and structural analysis of shadow banking activities. While the economic drivers of shadow banking in China are similar to those of the United States, our map points to several unique characteristics of the Chinese system. To measure the size and dynamics of shadow banking, we distinguish between three main stages of credit intermediation. This helps in better understanding the role, evolution and regulation of shadow banking activities in China.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Banks have been the dominant player in China's shadow banking system. This is why it is sometimes dubbed the "shadow of the banks". In contrast to shadow banking in the United States, securitisation and market-based instruments still play a rather limited role in China. As visualised in a series of maps for the period 2013-2016, the structure of the Chinese shadow banking system has been evolving rapidly.</p>
<p><a href="/publ/work/work701_map.jpg"><img src="/publ/work/work701_map_thumb.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While growth of shadow credit to ultimate borrowers has slowed, the use of shadow saving instruments (eg wealth management products, trust products) has continued to expand at a fast pace. New and more complex "structured" shadow credit intermediation aimed at reducing banks' regulatory burden has emerged and quickly reached a large scale. The bond market has become highly dependent on funding channelled through wealth management products. As a result, Chinese shadow banking is becoming slightly more similar to US shadow banking.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We develop a stylised shadow banking map for China with the aim of providing a coherent picture of its structure and the associated financial system interlinkages. Five key characteristics emerge. One defining feature of the shadow banking system in China is the dominant role of commercial banks, true to the adage that shadow banking in China is the "shadow of the banks". Moreover, it differs from shadow banking in the United States in that securitisation and market-based instruments play only a limited role. With a series of maps we show that the size and dynamics of shadow banking in China have been changing rapidly. This reveals a marked shift in the relative importance of different shadow banking activities. New and more complex "structured" shadow credit intermediation has emerged and quickly reached a large scale, while the bond market has become highly dependent on funding channelled through wealth management products.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Inflation forecasts are either "fixed event" (eg forecasts made each month for inflation in 2017) or "fixed horizon" (eg forecasts made each month for inflation over the coming 12 months). Fixed-event forecasts are preferable for some purposes, and fixed-horizon forecasts for others. However, fixed-event forecasts are generally more readily available than fixed-horizon ones. A common practice is therefore to convert fixed-event forecasts to fixed-horizon ones. We examine the effect of this conversion on the properties of the forecasts.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We focus on US forecast data that we can use to produce both actual and approximate fixed-horizon inflation forecasts with a 12-month horizon. We then compare the properties of the two. We find that there are quantitatively important differences between them. We also propose a partial fix for the conversion rule to improve the performance of the approximation.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We show that the approximation results in significant errors compared with the actual forecasts, equal to about 10% of the inflation rate. This error is more severe during recessions. In addition, measures of how much forecasters tend to disagree with each other, and how persistent forecasts are, may be misleading when we look at approximate forecasts instead of actual ones. We propose an improvement to the approximation, based on the idea that longer-horizon forecasts are more heavily "anchored" to a fixed number while shorter-horizon forecasts more strongly reflect recent inflation. In practical terms, the improvement means that we put a higher weight on longer-horizon forecasts, and a smaller weight on shorter-horizon forecasts, than the standard conversion rule suggests.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A common practice in studies using inflation forecasts is to approximate fixed-horizon forecasts with fixed-event ones. Here we show that this may be problematic. In a panel of US inflation forecast data that allows us to compare the two, the approximation results in a mean absolute approximation error of around 0.2-0.3 percentage points (around 10% of the level of inflation), and statistically significant differences in both the variances and persistence of the approximate inflation forecasts relative to the actual forecasts. To reduce these problems, we propose an adjustment to the approximation, consistent with a model where longer-horizon forecasts are more heavily "anchored", while shorter-horizon forecasts more closely reflect current inflation levels.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study how inflation expectations behave during periods of deflation. We analyse, in particular, whether inflation expectations become less well anchored. If expectations are less well anchored, they tend to be less stable and forecasters disagree to a greater extent about future inflation.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>After the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-09, the widespread shift to low inflation brought policymakers' concerns about deflation back to the fore. One reason is the effect of deflation on inflation expectations. Indeed, the downward drift in expectations was one reason for the introduction of unconventional monetary policy. However, research on expectations during deflations is scant. Moreover, views differ about the implications of deflations for the economy. Our contribution rests on a systematic analysis of professional forecasters' expectations. The study covers 43 advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs). In our global data set, most deflations occur in EMEs.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find evidence that inflation expectations are less well anchored during deflations. Inflation expectations tend to fall and depend more on past inflation. Forecasters also disagree more about future inflation when prices are falling. These shifts also cause greater disagreement about future output growth.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We analyse the behaviour of inflation expectations during periods of deflation, using a large cross-country data set of individual professional forecasters' expectations. We find some evidence that expectations become less well anchored during deflations. Deflations are associated with a downward shift in inflation expectations and a somewhat higher backward-lookingness of those expectations. We also find that deflations are correlated with greater forecast disagreement. Delving deeper into such disagreement, we find that deflations are associated with movements in the lefthand tail of the distribution. Econometric evidence indicates that such shifts may have consequences for real activity.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We look to history for lessons on the nature of money and the role of central banks in building trust in the use of money in society. The issue of trust has again come to the fore in debates on the durability of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and how far private money can supplant central bank money as a medium of exchange.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our study documents the economic crisis in Europe caused by uncontrolled currency debasement during the Thirty Years War (1618-48), and how the establishment of deposit banks rebuilt trust in monetary exchange. Our work builds on this historical experience by developing a model of how the institutional backing of deposit banks restored order. Establishing common knowledge of the value of money enabled trust. This brought about greater confidence in transactions and broader participation in economic activity, sparking a virtuous cycle.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our findings suggest that the deposit banks established in the 1600s have a claim to being the precursors of modern central banks, even though they were not designed to lend. Deposit banks were payment banks where deposits were fully backed by coins. However, they provided a notional currency - bank money - and a platform to settle financial transactions that rebuilt trust in monetary exchange. In the process, bank money established common knowledge in the value of a transaction. Studying past currency debasements is especially topical given the recent proliferation of cryptocurrencies and the practice of "forking", whereby new variants are created. These lessons provide background to the lecture by BIS General Manager Agustín Carstens on <a href="/speeches/sp180206.htm">Money in the digital age: what role for central banks?</a> Similarities between early deposit banks and modern central banks show how a solid institutional framework and public trust can underpin trust and ensure well functioning currencies.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Money is a social convention where one party accepts it as payment in the expectation that others will do so too. Over the ages, various forms of private money have come and gone, giving way to central bank money. The reasons for the resilience of central bank money are of particular interest given current debates about cryptocurrencies and how far they will supplant central bank money. We draw lessons from the role of public deposit banks in the 1600s, which quelled the hyper-in‡flation in Europe during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). As the precursors of modern central banks, public deposit banks established trust in monetary exchange by making the value of money common knowledge.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We contribute to a long literature on whether banks are more opaque than other firms. By opaque we mean that outsiders, such as investors or depositors, are less able to assess the soundness of a bank than that of another type of firm. An answer to this question has important implications for regulation. For instance, bank opacity could undermine market discipline.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We test whether banks are more opaque than other firms by looking at how equity prices respond to trades by bank or firm insiders. These are purchases or sales by senior company officials, who presumably have better information on the future performance of their institutions than outside investors. If companies are opaque, then insider purchases should be followed by increases in equity prices and insider sales by drops, at least on average. We believe that price responses to insider trades provide a better measure of opacity than the variables used in previous studies, such as bid-ask spreads, which are also affected by a range of other factors.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results do not support the conventional wisdom that banks are more opaque than other firms. Yes, purchases by bank insiders are followed by positive stock returns, indicating that banks are opaque. But banks are not special as we find the same effect for other firms. Where banks are special is when bad news arrive. We find that sales by bank insiders are not followed by negative stock returns. This suggests that bank insiders do not receive bad news earlier than outsiders. By contrast, insider sales at non-banks tend to be followed by a decline in stock prices.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We use trades by US corporate insiders to investigate bank opacity, both in absolute terms and relative to other firms. On average, bank insider sales do not earn an abnormal return and do not predict stock returns. By contrast, bank insider purchases do, even though less than other firms. Our within-banking sector and over-time analyses also fail to provide evidence of greater opacity of banks vis-à-vis other firms. These results challenge conventional wisdom and suggest that, to assess bank opacity, the type of benchmark (transparency vs. other firms) and transaction/information (purchase/positive vs. sale/negative) are crucial.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Commodity price swings are key drivers of inflation and naturally factor into monetary policy decisions. Our paper assesses the soundness of the conventional wisdom that central banks should largely ignore the initial impact of commodity prices on headline inflation. This approach is based on the 1970s experience, when commodity prices soared because of supply shortages. Now, demand plays a more prominent role. Trying to distinguish between demand and supply, however, raises the risk of misdiagnosing commodity price falls as being driven primarily by external supply shocks, such as new discoveries of oil reserves, when they are in fact driven by global demand shocks, such as a fall in consumer confidence. We look at how misdiagnoses may affect the stability of the global business cycle.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We show how to assess the monetary policy implications of misdiagnosing the drivers of commodity prices for output and inflation stabilisation. With our state-of-the-art approach, we examine the effectiveness of different monetary policy strategies and, therefore, of the conventional wisdom.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In general, the conventional approach fares poorly in our assessment. Targeting supply and demand shocks improves outcomes. However, this advice comes at a risk. Misdiagnosing the source of shocks is costly. Indeed, we argue that there is an inherent tendency for small economies to treat changes in commodity prices as being driven by global supply shocks even when the true driver is global demand. In this situation, central bank reactions around the world may end up destabilising, rather than stabilising, the global economy. We conclude that there may be gains from forging a new conventional wisdom and from encouraging greater monetary policy cooperation.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>How do monetary policy spillovers complicate the trade-offs faced by central banks face when responding to commodity prices? This question takes on particular relevance when monetary authorities find it difficult to accurately diagnose the drivers of commodity prices. If monetary authorities misdiagnose commodity price swings as being driven primarily by external supply shocks when they are in fact driven by global demand shocks, this conventional wisdom - to look through the first-round effects of commodity price fluctuations - may no longer be sound policy advice.</p>
<p>To analyse this question, we use the multi-country DSGE model of Nakov and Pescatori (2010) which breaks the global economy down into commodity-exporting and non-commodity-exporting economies. In an otherwise conventional DSGE setup, commodity prices are modelled as endogenously changing with global supply and demand developments, including global monetary policy conditions. This framework allows us to explore the implications of domestic monetary policy decisions when there is a risk of misdiagnosing the drivers of commodity prices. </p>
<p>The main findings are: i) monetary authorities deliver better economic performance when they are able to accurately identify the source of the shocks, ie global supply and demand shocks driving commodity prices; ii) when they find it difficult to identify the supply and demand shocks, monetary authorities can limit the deterioration in economic performance by targeting core inflation; and iii) the conventional wisdom approach of responding to global commodity price swings (as external supply shocks when they are truly global demand shocks) results in an excessive procyclicality of global inflation, output and commodity prices. In light of recent empirical studies documenting a significant role of global demand in driving commodity prices, we conclude that the systematic misdiagnoses inherent in the conventional wisdom applied at the country level have contributed to destabilising procyclicality at the global level. These findings support calls for greater attention to global factors in domestic monetary policymaking and highlight potential gains from greater monetary policy cooperation focused on accurate diagnoses of domestic and global sources of shocks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Exchange rates usually crop up in connection with international trade, but they also affect the economy through a financial channel. We investigate how this financial channel operates, and what impact it has on real investment. We also examine what the financial channel of exchange rates implies about the link between the strength of the US dollar, cross-border bank flows and real investment.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper adds to the evidence of the existence of the financial channel of exchange rates. It shows how the financial channel of exchange rates affects real investment, not just financial conditions. The effect on investment that we identify goes in the opposite direction to the textbook channel that emphasises trade competitiveness resulting from currency movements. In our story, a stronger dollar is associated with subdued real investment in emerging market economies (EMEs).</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>A stronger dollar tends to go hand in hand with more restrained investment activity in EMEs. In this sense, the dollar exchange rate is a barometer for risk appetite supporting real economic activity. Looking deeper, the link between the dollar and global investment originates in the way that the dollar affects credit supply conditions, especially credit supplied by banks. The body of evidence is also bolstered by the way that a stronger dollar tends to go together with more subdued cross-border bank lending. Importantly, the financial channel influences the real economy in the opposite direction to the standard trade channel, in that a depreciation of an EME currency against the dollar tends to dampen economic activity.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Exchange rate fluctuations influence economic activity not only via the standard trade channel, but also through a financial channel, which operates through the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on borrowers' balance sheets and lenders' risk-taking capacity. This paper explores the "triangular" relationship between (i) the strength of the US dollar, (ii) cross-border bank flows and (iii) real investment. We conduct two sets of empirical exercises - a macro (country-level) study and a micro (firm-level) study. We find that a stronger dollar is associated with lower growth in dollar-denominated cross-border bank flows and lower real investment in emerging market economies. An important policy implication of our findings is that a stronger dollar has real macroeconomic effects that go in the opposite direction to the standard trade channel.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Our paper provides a fresh take on the way the US dollar exchange rate influences the volume of global trade. We take as our starting point the substantial financing needs of the long supply chains, or global value chains (GVCs), that underpin trade in manufactured goods. These financial needs make GVCs susceptible to fluctuations in the supply of dollar-denominated trade credit. As a stronger dollar goes hand-in-hand with tighter dollar credit supply, the impact of a strong dollar can run counter to the traditional understanding of the impact of exchange rates on trade.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper is one of a number of new approaches to international trade that tackle the puzzle of why the dollar exchange rate affects global trade volumes. Our paper is distinctive in basing the explanation on the working capital demands of GVCs. We build on previous work showing that, when firms depend more on external financing, their inventories fall more sharply when credit supply dries up. We extend this by taking a global view and considering the prevalence of dollar invoicing in global trade, based on data from more than 2,000 companies. Globally, about 80% of trade finance is denominated in dollars.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that a stronger dollar heralds tighter credit conditions and thus dampens GVC activity. As a result, a country's exports may fall when its currency depreciates against the dollar. This runs counter to the conventional view that a weaker currency helps exporters by making their goods comparatively cheaper for overseas consumers. The paradoxical results undermine arguments that tighter trade and investment links can be forged without any need for increased financial openness. Real and financial globalisation go hand in hand.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper seeks to estimate the extent of nepotism in U.S. public firms and assess the implications for corporate investment.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper provides a first assessment of how widespread nepotistic hiring practices are. While a large number of papers explore the consequences of family ownership, the literature is silent about the implications of family ties among employees in top roles.</p>
<p>As nepotism induces an adverse selection of the managers in charge of investment decisions, a natural question is whether nepotism hinders valuable corporate investment. This paper provides a set of tests to determine whether that is the case and quantify this effect.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Running a battery of empirical tests, we find that nepotism has an economically significant detrimental effect on both capital investment and investment in research. This negative effect arises because of lower responsiveness to investment opportunities of firms that employ relatives.</p>
<p>We provide suggestive evidence that lower skill and lack of incentives of top managers contribute to explain the lower sensitivity to investment opportunities. We discuss the implications at a macroeconomic level.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Nepotism emerges in a multiplicity of contexts from political assignments to firm hiring decisions, but what are its real effects on the economy? This paper explores how nepotism affects corporate investment. To measure nepotism, we build a unique dataset of family connections among individuals employed in strategic positions by the same firm. We address endogeneity concerns by exploiting the heterogeneity in ancestries across U.S. counties to construct a measure of inherited family values. We find that firms headquartered in counties where locals inherited strong family values exhibit more nepotism. Using this measure and the percentage of family households in the county as instrumental variables, we provide evidence that nepotism hinders investment. Overall, our results suggest that underinvestment in these firms is driven by both lower quality of hired workers and lower incentive to exert effort.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper examines the relationship between monetary policy and market prices through the lens of central bank communication. Central bankers use forward guidance to steer market expectations of future monetary policy moves. At the same time, they rely on market prices to gauge the likely path of the economy and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. This two-way flow between market prices and forward guidance can create a circularity, and raises questions on how best to read market signals without distorting those same prices.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The research is timely given the increasing importance of communication as a tool for central banks, especially since policy rates have been pushed down to their feasible lower limits. Policymakers are giving more speeches, holding more news conferences and embracing new communication channels on social media. They are also paying more attention to signals from financial markets. One example is market expectations of future inflation, also detailed in the speech "<a href="/speeches/sp171114.htm">Can central banks talk too much?</a>". This paper builds on previous theoretical contributions to construct a self-contained quantitative analysis of central bank communication and market prices. It raises important questions and provides insights on the effectiveness and design of forward guidance.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The analysis suggests that relying less on market signals increases the effectiveness of central bank communication. In their eagerness to correctly anticipate policy moves, market participants risk giving too much weight to central bankers' utterances and not enough to assessing economic data. If central bankers, in turn, trust markets to guide their actions, they may end up creating a feedback loop that cancels out the value of the very market signals they rely on. In this circular relationship, market outcomes reflect central bank actions, which in turn reflect market outcomes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Was the lacklustre economic recovery due in part to the waning effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) amid low interest rates? Or was it due to the economy's lower sensitivity to interest rates? For answers, we look at experiences with monetary policy in the major advanced economies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We contribute to monetary policy research in three ways. First, we show how a recently designed UMP model can be exploited to jointly test for changing UMP effectiveness and interest rate sensitivity. Second, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for bank lending behaviour in the monetary transmission mechanism. This captures the often overlooked pass-through from monetary policy to the lending rates that borrowers actually face. Third, we consider common UMP experiences across the major advanced economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The stimulative effect of UMPs has weakened over the past decade. But, there is little evidence that economies have become less interest rate-sensitive. What explains this finding? A fall in the estimated "natural" rate (ie short-run benchmark for the stance of monetary policy). The fall effectively sapped the stimulative power of lower policy rates and larger central bank balance sheets.</p>
<p>Although a fall in the "natural" rate is not a new result, our evidence points to a less conventional explanation. Monetary policy itself appears to be the culprit, via signalling and safe asset channels. Looking ahead, our findings point to an expected rise in the "natural" rate during the normalisation of monetary policy. That is, our model suggests that higher policy rates in the major advanced economies could coincide with an increase in estimated "natural" rates. If central banks place too little weight on this possibility, an overly procyclical monetary policy could result, and central banks could find themselves unwittingly falling progressively behind the curve.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Have unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) become less effective at stimulating economies in persistently low interest rate environments? This paper examines that question with a time-varying parameter VAR for the United States, the United Kingdom, the euro area and Japan. One advantage of our approach is the ability to measure an economy's evolving interest rate sensitivity during the post-GFC macroeconomy. Another advantage is the ability to capture time variation in the "natural", or steady state, rate of interest, which allows us to separate interest rate movements that are associated with changes in the stance of monetary policy from those that are not.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper examines whether movements in exchange rates are transmitted (or "pass through") to a country's prices in full, and whether the relationship between the exchange rate and prices is linear and stable over time. The paper uses monthly data from a small open economy and a smooth transition auto-regressive vector model estimated by Bayesian methods.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>In previous studies, as well as in policy analysis, it is often assumed that the pass-through of exchange rates into prices does not change over time. Our study shows that, on the contrary, the pass-through does vary over time and documents its characteristics and the factors that affect its behaviour. An important implication is that models used by central banks for monetary policy decisions should take these characteristics of the pass-through into account.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Two key findings may be highlighted: (1) a shock to exchange rates does not pass through completely into prices, even in the case of import prices; and (2) the pass-through will vary depending on the state of the economy and the type of shock affecting the economy and the exchange rate.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper examines the nature of the pass-through of exchange rate shocks on prices along the distribution chain, and estimates its short and long-term path. It uses monthly data from a small open economy and a smooth transition auto-regressive vector model estimated by Bayesian methods. The main finding is that exchange rate pass-through is nonlinear and state and shock dependent. There are two main policy implications of these findings. First, models used by central banks for policymaking should take into account the nonlinear and endogenous nature of the pass-through. Second, a specific rule on pass-through for monetary policy decisions should be avoided.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We present a methodology for describing the economic conditions in which substantial price differences can persist for two similar financial instruments traded in the spot and derivatives markets. Arbitrageurs conduct trades that should reduce these price differences. But trades only become profitable for an arbitrageur if a critical threshold, the transaction cost, is exceeded. The existence of thresholds leads to the potential for abrupt adjustments and the tendency for prices to behave in different ways under differing conditions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We use a new methodology for estimating unknown transaction costs in markets with frictions. When monitoring market distortions, it is important for regulators to understand these dynamics in terms of transaction costs and speed of price adjustments. We present two applications: arbitrage trading of palladium and the S&amp;P 500 index.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We estimate transaction costs, as well as the long-run equilibrium, using a sequential grid search. We present a comprehensive simulation study to test our model's reliability. Persistent increases or jumps in transaction costs may hint at market distortions. We find that, with our methodology, the transaction costs for a negative and a positive basis trade are estimated with a very high degree of precision, suggesting that our method is reliable.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We present a methodology for estimating a 3-regime threshold vector error correction model (TVECM) with an unknown cointegrating vector based on a new dynamic grid evaluation. This model is particularly suited to estimating deviations from parity conditions such as unknown arbitrage costs in markets with a persistent non-zero basis between two similar financial market instruments traded in the spot and the derivative markets. Our proposed 3-regime TVECM can estimate the area where arbitrageurs have no incentives for trading. Only when the basis exceeds a critical threshold, where the potential gain from the basis trade exceeds the overall transaction costs, do we expect arbitrageurs to step in and carry out the respective trade. This leads to non-linear adjustment dynamics and regimes with different characteristics. The overall transaction costs for the basis trades can be inferred from the estimated no-arbitrage regime. Our methodology allows us to quantify overall transaction costs for an arbitrage trade in markets where trading costs are opaque or unknown, as in credit risk or index arbitrage trading. The key contributions of this paper are the further development of the 2-threshold VECM, together with the numerical evaluation of the model through numerous simulations to prove its robustness. We present two short applications of the model in arbitrage trades in the palladium market and index trading for the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Many studies have shown that domestic inflation in different countries tends to behave similarly. One possible explanation for this observation is that domestic inflation dynamics are in part determined by global factors. This implies that central banks need to account for global factors when explaining and predicting inflation. Their importance however depends on whether they have long lasting effects on domestic inflation rates.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Using a large macroeconomic dataset, we propose a methodology to decompose inflation into its permanent (trend) and transitory (gap) components. We then quantify the role of domestic and global factors in determining each of these components. We first apply the model to a sample of economies with long-standing inflation targeting regimes. We then extend our analysis to a sample of ten Asian economies to draw comparisons.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>In our first sample, we find that global factors have a sizeable influence on inflation behaviour.   However, this is mainly temporary and appears to reflect movements in commodity prices. The effect of global factors on trend inflation is small. In our second sample, a set of countries with more diverse monetary policy regimes, we find global factors have a much larger role. A possible explanation is that inflation targeting may have reduced the influence of global factors on trend inflation.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We develop a model to empirically study the influence of global factors in driving trend inflation and the inflation gap.We apply our model to five established inflation targeters and a group of heterogeneous Asian economies. Our results suggest that while global factors can have a sizeable influence on the inflation gap, they play only a marginal role in driving trend inflation. Much of the influence of global factors in the inflation gap may be reflecting commodity price shocks. We also find global factors have a greater influence on inflation, and especially trend inflation, for the group of Asian economies relative to the established inflation targeters. A possible interpretation is that inflation targeting may have reduced the influence of global factors on inflation, and especially so on trend inflation.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper measures the importance of risk-taking in foreign investment in U.S. corporate bonds. Low interest rates have been argued to spur the search for yield. This can affect domestic investments, but also capital flows across countries, including into key advanced economies such as the United States.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper tests for search for yield by examining whether changes in interest rates in 36 countries drove domestic investors to shift into riskier assets in the United States. The analysis uses unique, security-level data on foreign holdings in close to 15,000 U.S. corporate bonds between 2003 and 2016.</p>
<p>We overcome challenges faced by other studies by focusing on interest rates in the investor country and not the destination country, and using data on foreign investments. Rates in the destination country depend on economic conditions, which have an impact on borrowers' riskiness and their demand for external financing. This makes it hard to separate out the impact of rates on risk-taking in the same economy. And when investments affect spreads for individual borrowers, spreads cannot be used are measures of borrowers' risks. Foreign holdings, which are typically small, do not raise this problem.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find clear evidence that the more interest rates at home decline, the more investors shift their international bond portfolios toward riskier U.S. corporate bonds. Effects are even stronger when home interest rates reach a low level, suggesting that risk-taking accelerates as rates decline. These effects hold regardless of secondary market liquidity and other factors.</p>
<p>We cannot tell whether this behaviour also applies to other investment patterns, since we not have those data. But if it does, this could bring financial stability risks, particularly if the low-rate environment persists.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The risk-taking effects of low interest rates, now prevailing in many advanced countries, ("search-for-yield") are hard to analyze due to both a paucity of data and challenges in identification. Unique, security-level data on portfolio investment into the United States allow us to overcome both problems. Analyzing holdings of investors from 36 countries in close to 15,000 unique U.S. corporate bonds between 2003 and 2016, we show that declining home-country interest rates lead investors to shift their international bond portfolios toward riskier U.S. corporate bonds, consistent with "search-for-yield". We estimate even stronger effects when home interest rates reach a low level, suggesting that risk-taking in securities accelerates as rates decline.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper asks which are the key factors that affect bank profitability in emerging market economies. In particular, it assesses to which extent bank profits are determined by country-wide and/or by bank specific factors.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper contributes to the literature by focusing on banks from emerging markets. Balance sheet data from 534 banks from 19 countries were analysed, both in terms of overall profitability and several of its sub-components (net interest margins, non-interest income and loan loss provisions). The study compares the relative importance of the financial and of the business cycles for bank profitability. Equally, the effects of short-term and of long-term interest rates for bank profitability were analysed separately. The paper also quantifies how sound fiscal balances can improve overall bank profitability by reducing risk premia. The paper discusses several mechanisms that may explain the patterns of EME bank profitability that have been observed between 2000 and 2014.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that credit growth is a stronger driver of bank profitability than GDP growth, except during very steep recessions. Further, we find that high long-term interest rates tend to boost profitability while high short-term interest rates reduce it, with the former effect generally dominating the latter. Furthermore, we find that increasing sovereign risk premia tend to reduce overall bank profitability.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We analyse key determinants of bank profitability based on the evolution of balance sheets of 534 banks from 19 emerging market economies. We find that higher long-term interest rates tend to boost profitability, while higher short-term rates reduce profits by raising funding costs. We also find that in normal times credit growth tends to be more important for bank profitability than GDP growth. The financial cycle thus appears to predict bank profitability better than the business cycle. We also show that increases in sovereign risk premia reduce bank profits in a significant way, underscoring the role of credible fiscal frameworks in supporting the overall financial stability.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study the reasons for the decline in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates over the last 30 years. We test the common claim that the decline purely reflects non-monetary factors that drive saving and investment. We also examine the role of monetary policy. This matters because the standard view rules it out.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The analysis is comprehensive. We consider a very long period, 1870-2016, and 19 countries. We examine many popular non-monetary factors: output and productivity growth, several demographic variables, the relative price of capital, inequality and risk. And we explore the role of monetary policy frameworks. The rich sample is necessary to test the hypotheses systematically. It lets us assess whether observed patterns are coincidental or reflect stable relationships.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The standard non-monetary factors do not explain real interest rates well. The patterns seen in the past 30 years appear coincidental. By contrast, monetary policy frameworks seem to play a more significant role. Our findings raise questions about some deeply-held beliefs that underpin macroeconomic analysis and policy.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Prevailing explanations of the decline in real interest rates since the early 1980s are premised on the notion that real interest rates are driven by variations in desired saving and investment. But based on data stretching back to 1870 for 19 countries, our systematic analysis casts doubt on this view. The link between real interest rates and saving-investment determinants appears tenuous. While it is possible to find some relationships consistent with the theory in some periods, particularly over the last 30 years, they do not survive over the extended sample. This holds both at the national and global level. By contrast, we find evidence that persistent shifts in real interest rates coincide with changes in monetary regimes. Moreover, external influences on countries' real interest rates appear to reflect idiosyncratic variations in interest rates of countries that dominate global monetary and financial conditions rather than common movements in global saving and investment. All this points to an underrated role of monetary policy in determining real interest rates over long horizons.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Economist Robert Triffin held that there is an inherent conflict in a national currency also serving as a global reserve currency, because domestic and international policy goals do not generally match. The paper seeks to set the record straight about Triffin's argument and its application to current policy debates.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Triffin's work is regularly cited as an argument against the US dollar's de facto role as pre-eminent global reserve currency. The paper adds context to the discussion by pointing out gaps in Triffin's reasoning, as well as limitations and flaws in modern extensions of his dilemma.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Triffin gained enormous influence by arguing that the gold shortage and the increasing use of the dollar as official reserves would inevitably lead to a run on US gold holdings, and threaten deflation. Although the dollar gold standard did eventually collapse, we argue that better and feasible US policies could have kept it going. </p>
<p>This history serves as a backdrop to our critical review of two later extensions of Triffin. One holds that the dollar's reserve role required US current account deficits. This current account Triffin is popular, but anachronistic, and flawed in logic and fact. Nevertheless, it pops up in debates over the euro's and the renminbi's reserve roles. A fiscal Triffin holds that global demand for safe assets will either remain dangerously unsatisfied, or force excessive US fiscal debt. Less flawed, this story posits implausibly inflexible demand for and supply of safe assets. </p>
<p>Triffin's seeming predictive success leads economists to wrap his brand around dissimilar stories. Yet Triffin's dilemma in its most general form correctly points to the conflicts and difficulties that arise when a national currency plays a role as an international public good.</p>
<div class="hr">

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Triffin gained enormous influence by reviving the interwar story that gold scarcity threatened deflation. In particular, he held that central banks needed to accumulate claims on the United States to back money growth. But the claims would eventually surpass the US gold stock and then central banks would inevitably stage a run on it. He feared that the resulting high US interest rates would cause global deflation. However, we show that the US gold position after WWII was no worse than the UK position in 1900. Yet it took WWI to break sterling's gold link. And better and feasible US policies could have kept Bretton Woods going. </p>
<p>This history serves as a backdrop to our critical review of two later extensions of Triffin. One holds that the dollar's reserve role required US current account deficits. This <em>current account Triffin</em> is popular, but anachronistic, and flawed in logic and fact. Nevertheless, it pops up in debates over the euro's and the renminbi's reserve roles. A <em>fiscal Triffin</em> holds that global demand for safe assets will either remain dangerously unsatisfied, or force excessive US fiscal debt. Less flawed, this story posits implausibly inflexible demand for and supply of safe assets. Thus, these stories do not convince in their own terms. Moreover, each lacks Triffin's clear cross-over point from a stable system to an unstable one. </p>
<p>Triffin's seeming predictive success leads economists to wrap his brand around dissimilar stories. Yet Triffin's dilemma in its most general form correctly points to the conflicts and difficulties that arise when a national currency plays a role as an international public good. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Regulators apply macroprudential measures to make the financial system more stable. These measures may also stabilize cross-border bank lending during times of stress. To test this theory, we examine how macroprudential measures stabilized cross-border bank lending during the "taper tantrum", after Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Ben Bernanke's signal in mid-2013 that the Fed would start scaling back asset purchases.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper is the first to analyse the stabilising impact of macroprudential tools during the "taper tantrum" episode, which sparked a U.S. dollar funding shock in international financial markets. Our study draws on a unique dataset, combining the Bank for International Settlements' International Banking Statistics with the International Banking Research Network's prudential regulatory database.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that macroprudential tools did stabilise cross-border bank lending growth. Borrowers' host countries that made more active use of these tools before the taper tantrum, received more stable lending. This was true for lending to both banks and non-banks. The stabilising effect was stronger in advanced economies than in emerging markets. Among the various tools, changing concentration limits to restrict banks' exposures to specific sectors, altering loan-to-value ratio caps, and changing local currency reserve requirements were very effective. Finally, our results suggest that policymakers may consider applying macroprudential tools to soften the impact of financial shocks. Macroprudential tools contribute to the stability of the domestic financial system and also encourage cross-border bank lending into the economy.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We study the effect of macroprudential measures on cross-border lending during the taper tantrum, which a saw strong slowdown in cross-border bank lending to some jurisdictions. We use a novel dataset combining the BIS Stage 1 enhanced banking statistics on bilateral cross-border lending flows with the IBRN's macroprudential database. Our results suggest that macroprudential measures implemented in borrowers' host countries prior to the taper tantrum significantly reduced the negative effect of the tantrum on cross-border lending growth. The shock-mitigating effect of host country macroprudential rules are present both in lending to banks and non-banks, and are strongest for lending flows to borrowers in advanced economies and to the non-bank sector in general. Source (lending) banking system measures do not affect bilateral lending flows, nor do they enhance the effect of host country macroprudential measures. Our results imply that policymakers may consider applying macroprudential tools to mitigate international shock transmission through cross-border bank lending.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Analysts often refer to bank business models, but there is no established notion of what a bank business model is or how one model differs from another. In this paper, we lay out a method for classifying banks into distinct business models and apply this method to data on balance sheet ratios. We also study banks' performance in each model and relate performance to transitions across models.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>A reliable way to identify bank business models is useful to both bank investors and policymakers. Depending on their business models, banks emphasise some activities over others. A good match between a model and available opportunities helps profitability, a key concern for stakeholders. More information about models gives supervisors more insight into banks' resilience and helps them identify broader risks in the banking system. Switching from one model to another can help an underperforming bank survive. Our classification method is mainly data-driven but also incorporates judgment in a systematic way. The data cover 178 banks from 34 countries over the period 2005-15. To focus on stable results, we filter out classifications that are sensitive to input data or the specific classification algorithm.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We identify four business models. Two involve commercial banks with large loan portfolios but with differences in their funding base: one is mainly retail-funded, through deposits, and the other wholesale-funded, through bonds and interbank markets. A third model emphasises trading activities, for which banks hold securities portfolios funded in the interbank and wholesale markets. The fourth, universal, banking model is a mix of the other three.</p>
<p>There are clear patterns in banks' performance and transitions from one business model to another. The two commercial banking models show lower cost-to-income ratios and more stable return-on-equity than the trading model. In a reversal of a pre-crisis trend, many banks moved away from wholesale-funded and into retail-funded banking after 2008. Over the entire sample period, banks that switched to the retail-funded model improved their return-on-equity by 2.5 percentage points on average compared to non-switchers. By contrast, the relative performance of banks switching into the wholesale-funded model deteriorated by 5 percentage points on average.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We allocate banks to distinct business models by experimenting with various combinations of balance sheet characteristics as inputs in cluster analysis. Using a panel of 178 banks for the period 2005-15, we identify a retail-funded and a wholesale-funded commercial banking model that are robust to the choice of inputs. In comparison, a model emphasising trading activities and a universal banking model are less robustly identified. Both commercial banking models exhibit lower cost-to-income ratios and more stable return-on-equity than the trading model. In a reversal of a pre-crisis trend, the crisis aftermath witnessed mainly switches away from wholesale-funded and into retail-funded banking. Over the entire sample period, banks that switched into the retail-funded model saw their return-on-equity improve by 2.5 percentage points on average relative to non-switchers. By contrast, the relative performance of banks switching into the wholesale-funded model deteriorated by 5 percentage points on average.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper looks at whether the determinants of corporate leverage in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) changed after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). In particular, the role played by global factors in driving leverage in EMEs is examined.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Earlier studies stressed the role played by domestic macroeconomic and firm-specific factors in determining corporate leverage. We evaluate the changing nature of these domestic factors post-GFC, using, in particular, a domestic financial conditions indicator (FCI) for each EME as a determinant of leverage. In addition, we explore the role of global factors in the build-up of leverage.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our findings suggest that global financial spillovers significantly affected EMEs through corporate leverage. Indeed, we find that post-GFC global macroeconomic conditions, as proxied by the growth of global GDP and the Fed shadow rate, contributed significantly to the sharp rise of leverage in EMEs.</p>
<p>Employing panel GMM and quantile analysis, we find that large but less profitable firms build-up more leverage post-GFC. This suggests that the prolonged period of abundant global liquidity post-GFC resulted in looser credit evaluation, thus favouring less profitable firms. The results of quantile regression suggest that firms in the lowest quantile increased their leverage the most in the post-GFC period. As the policy rate cycle turns in advanced economies and EMEs, corporate deleveraging may become a more urgent necessity. The challenge for policymakers will be to ensure resilience of their financial sectors to such deleveraging.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper evaluates whether the GFC was instrumental in changing the determinants of corporate leverage in EMEs. This issue is addressed using a panel-GMM framework and quantile analysis with a database comprising more than 2,000 firms in 10 EMEs over a 19-year period. We find that, post-GFC, global financial market and macroeconomic conditions facilitated build-up of corporate leverage. Specifically, global factors, such as the growth of world GDP and the FED shadow rate, have assumed centre stage as determinants of leverage in EMEs. At the same time, some traditional drivers, such as domestic growth and firm-specific factors, have become less important.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>In the wake of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), all major advanced economy central banks sought to stimulate the economy through large-scale asset purchase programmes. There is widespread agreement that this stimulus was critical to halting the crisis and to preventing a deeper and longer-lasting recession. The lacklustre recovery from the GFC has, however, raised questions about whether the measures have been effective over time. Some observers have also voiced concerns that asset purchases may have inflated stock prices.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper assesses the impact of asset purchases in the United Kingdom and the United States on the broader economy and on stock prices. Specifically, we compare the effects of the first programmes, from 2008 until mid-2011, with those of programmes launched after mid-2011. We also assess in a novel approach the bearing of market expectations on effectiveness, looking at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealer survey.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results suggest that the initial asset purchase programmes significantly helped the economy, while the subsequent ones had little or no impact. The reduced effectiveness of the later programmes seems to partly reflect the fact that market participants priced in changes in asset purchases before they were announced. This follows from our finding that increases in the expected size of the Federal Reserve's last asset purchase programme had significant positive economic effects. Finally, in all cases we find that asset purchases pushed up stock prices significantly.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper revisits the macroeconomic effects of the large-scale asset purchase programmes launched by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England from 2008. Using a Bayesian VAR, we investigate the macroeconomic impact of shocks to asset purchase announcements and assess changes in their effectiveness based on subsample analysis. The results suggest that the early asset purchase programmes had significant positive macroeconomic effects, while those of the subsequent ones were weaker and in part not significantly different from zero. The reduced effectiveness seems to reflect in part better anticipation of asset purchase programmes over time, since we find significant positive macroeconomic effects when we consider shocks to survey expectations of the Federal Reserve's last asset purchase programme. Finally, in all estimations we find a significant and persistent positive impact of asset purchase shocks on stock prices.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper shows how banks in Europe use Credit Default Swaps (CDS). We analyse whether and how banks use the CDS market to buy or sell protection on the default of firms they lend to (via syndicated loans).</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The main novelty of our paper is the combination of different detailed datasets capturing the amounts lent by banks to non-financial corporations in the syndicated loan market, the amounts of default protection bought and sold by banks in the CDS market, and balance sheet data for banks. We are the first to perform a cross-country analysis on the usage of CDS. Our broadest sample contains 1,022 banks from 28 countries that lend to 14,660 different firms from 144 countries. Finally, our data allows us to identify ways in which CDS can distort the syndicated loan market.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We document that banks use the CDS market for position taking (i.e. to "double up" to some extent on their credit risk exposures to a particular firm). Using standard statistical tools, we find that banks tend to hedge a larger share of loans to relatively riskier firms, and that banks with  higher leverage, more wholesale funding, and lower return on assets tend to insure less of their exposures. We find no evidence that banks use the CDS market to lower regulatory risk-based capital ratios, or in other words to seek capital relief, as some argue. Domestic exposures are less likely to be doubled-up than cross-border exposures. Finally, our results show that the main lender in a syndicate tends to insure more of its credit risk than its partners and therefore has less at stake if the firm defaults. This exacerbates the uneven distribution of information and can distort market functioning.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes banks' usage of CDS. Combining bank-firm syndicated loan data with a unique EU-wide dataset on bilateral CDS positions, we find that stronger banks in terms of capital, funding and profitability tend to hedge more. We find no evidence of banks using the CDS market for capital relief. Banks are more likely to hedge exposures to relatively riskier borrowers and less likely to sell CDS protection on domestic firms. Lead arrangers tend to buy more protection, potentially exacerbating asymmetric information problems. Dealer banks seem insensitive to firm risk, and hedge more than non-dealers when they are more profitable. These results allow for a better understanding of banks' credit risk management.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Contingent convertible capital securities (CoCos) are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level. CoCos can absorb losses either by converting into common equity or by suffering a principal writedown. They have a "trigger" which can be either mechanical (that is, defined numerically in terms of a specific capital ratio) or discretionary (that is, subject to supervisory judgment).</p>
<p>CoCos have become an important part of the post-crisis regulatory framework. However, up until now there has been little evidence on how they work in practice. The lack of research on the topic has been largely due to data scarcity.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We compile the first comprehensive data set on global CoCo issuance. Our sample covers CoCos issued between 2009 and 2015. It contains 731 instruments with a combined volume of $521 billion.</p>
<p>We conduct two sets of empirical exercises. First, we examine the determinants of CoCo issuance. Second, we evaluate the impact of CoCo issuance on the credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices of issuing banks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our analysis leads to four main findings. First, larger and better-capitalised banks are more likely to issue CoCos. Second, issuing CoCos causes the issuers' CDS spreads to decline. This indicates that CoCos reduce banks' credit risk and lower their funding costs. This is especially true for CoCos that convert into equity or have mechanical triggers. Third, CoCos with only discretionary triggers do not have a significant impact on CDS spreads. Fourth, CoCo issues do not affect stock prices, except for principal writedown CoCos with a high trigger level, which have a positive effect.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The promise of contingent convertible capital securities (CoCos) as a 'bail-in' solution has been the subject of considerable theoretical analysis and debate, but little is known about their effects in practice. In this paper, we undertake the first comprehensive empirical analysis of bank CoCo issues, a market segment that comprises over 730 instruments totaling $521 billion. Four main findings emerge: 1) The propensity to issue a CoCo is higher for larger and better-capitalized banks; 2) CoCo issues result in statistically significant declines in issuers' CDS spreads, indicating that they generate risk-reduction benefits and lower costs of debt. This is especially true for CoCos that: i) convert into equity, ii) have mechanical triggers, iii) are classified as Additional Tier 1 instruments; 3) CoCos with only discretionary triggers do not have a significant impact on CDS spreads; 4) CoCo issues have no statistically significant impact on stock prices, except for principal write-down CoCos with a high trigger level, which have a positive effect.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Over the last decade, recognition has grown that developments in the financial sector can have a significant impact on the real economy, not just the other way around. However, our understanding of these interactions remains limited, particularly regarding how they operate across national borders.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper reviews research on links between the financial sector, which suffers from imperfections, and the real economy. It focuses on two major channels through which financial market imperfections can affect the real economy. On the demand (borrowing) side, changes in borrowers' balance sheets can affect access to finance and thereby amplify and spread economic and financial shocks. On the supply (lending) side, changes in banks' and other lenders' balance sheets and the state of financial markets can affect the supply of credit, liquidity and asset prices, and thereby economic outcomes.</p>
<p>The paper emphasises the global dimensions of these dynamics and attempts to identify gaps in the literature.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds that there has been substantial progress in identifying demand-side channels, with many economic models now featuring amplification mechanisms. The stylised features of business and financial cycles and their links are now better documented. However, there has been less headway in modelling supply-side channels.</p>
<p>The paper identifies four promising areas for additional work. First, to develop richer models of demand- and supply-side channels, especially the latter. Second, to improve data about the behaviour of firms and households to identify what drives linkages between business and financial cycles. Third, to better analyse the cross-border transmission of financial and real shocks. Fourth, to incorporate the findings into the design of policy, including macroprudential and monetary policy.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on the macroeconomic implications of financial imperfections. It focuses on two major channels through which financial imperfections can affect macroeconomic outcomes. The first channel, which operates through the demand side of finance and is captured by financial accelerator-type mechanisms, describes how changes in borrowers' balance sheets can affect their access to finance and thereby amplify and propagate economic and financial shocks. The second channel, which is associated with the supply side of finance, emphasises the implications of changes in financial intermediaries' balance sheets for the supply of credit, liquidity and asset prices, and, consequently, for macroeconomic outcomes. These channels have been shown to be important in explaining the linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. That said, many questions remain.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Since the Great Financial Crisis, there has been a greater recognition of the linkages between asset prices and the real economy. Yet, many issues remain to be explored, including the drivers of asset prices, their quantitative impact on aggregate activity, including consumption and investment, and their international dimensions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper sums up the literature on this topic and focuses on three major questions. What are the basic theoretical linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes? What is the empirical evidence supporting these linkages? What are the main challenges to the theoretical and empirical findings?</p>
<p>The paper reviews the evolution of the literature on the determinants of equity prices, house prices, exchange rates and interest rates and their linkages with macroeconomic outcomes. It discusses possible directions for future research.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds asset prices are much more volatile than economic fundamentals would imply. Investment and consumption at times respond differently to changes in asset prices than standard models would suggest. There are limits to the predictive ability of asset prices for real activity. These findings apply both domestically and internationally. Finally, financial imperfections play an important role in explaining the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes.</p>
<p>The paper identifies three promising areas for additional work. First, to fill some of the large gaps in microeconomic and sectoral data. Second, to develop models that can better account for the diverse behaviour of agents, financial imperfections, differences in financial and institutional structures across countries, and global linkages and spillovers. Third, to design monetary and other policies which better account for asset prices, especially for small open economies.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper surveys the literature on the linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes. It focuses on three major questions. First, what are the basic theoretical linkages between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes? Second, what is the empirical evidence supporting these linkages? And third, what are the main challenges to the theoretical and empirical findings? The survey addresses these questions in the context of four major asset price categories: equity prices, house prices, exchange rates and interest rates, with a particular focus on their international dimensions. It also puts into perspective the evolution of the literature on the determinants of asset prices and their linkages with macroeconomic outcomes, and discusses possible future research directions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper assesses the effectiveness of dynamic provisioning and conditional reserve requirements, in Peru, where banks can grant loans in both domestic currency and US dollars. These measures had two distinct policy objectives. Dynamic provisioning aims to reduce the procyclicality of credit by allowing banks to build up loan loss provisions when their profits are growing in order to draw from them during economic downturns. Requiring higher reserves aims to reduce the dollarisation of the economy depending on the level of outstanding foreign currency credit.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>For this analysis, we employ a novel credit dataset covering the period of 2004-2014. This dataset contains detailed information on outstanding loans at the bank-debtor level. The database also contains information on loans in domestic and foreign currency. A highly dollarised banking system like Peru's can be vulnerable when the national currency depreciates. Moreover, over the past decade, credit in Peru has grown significantly. The mounting credit risk has created severe challenges for financial regulators.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds that dynamic provisioning slowed the high growth of commercial bank lending. This suggests that it helped reduce credit procyclicality. Second, banks with higher capital ratios were better able to expand credit. These banks were able to mitigate the impact of dynamic provisioning on their credit supply. Third, putting additional reserve requirements on foreign currency mortgage lending reduced dollarisation. In particular, this policy created incentives for banks to substitute dollar-denominated loans and expand credit in domestic currency.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, credit has grown significantly in Peru, a small and partially dollarised economy, and the mounting credit risk attached to foreign currency credit created severe challenges for financial regulators. This paper assesses the effectiveness of two macroprudential measures implemented by regulators: dynamic provisioning, to reduce the procyclicality of credit and conditional reserve requirements, to diminish the degree of dollarisation of the economy. Using credit register data that covers the period of 2004-2014, we find evidence that dynamic provisioning has decelerated the rapid growth of commercial bank lending. Moreover, mortgage dollarisation declined significantly after the implementation of the conditional reserve requirement scheme.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper estimates the impact of changing reserve requirements for banks on the credit supply in Brazil. We use a database that covers virtually all loans to private non-financial firms from the first quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2015. During this period, there were several interventions using reserve requirements. In our first exercise, we average the reserve requirement shocks using a macroprudential policy index. In a second exercise, we focus on the response of credit supply to relaxing reserve requirements in 2008, in response to a credit crunch, and tightening them in 2010 when credit was overheating.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The reaction to changes in reserve requirements may depend on the state of the economy and on bank characteristics. It also has implications on the composition of credit and the riskiness of borrowers. Estimates of the effects of reserve requirements on the credit supply are important for emerging markets, particularly for countries that use this tool to smooth the credit cycle. However, there is little loan-level evidence of the impact of reserve requirements. We explore a larger and longer dataset with policy shocks from tightening and easing cycles.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results from the first exercise show that easing reserve requirements increases lending by the affected banks compared to  non-affected banks. A tightening of reserve requirements has the opposite effect. From the second exercise, we find that the tightening phase of reserve requirements had less impact on lending than the easing one. This suggests that the supply of bank credit reacts more to an easing than to a tightening. We find evidence that these policies have less impact on small and foreign banks. Finally, banks are prone to lend less to riskier firms during easing and more to riskier firms during tightening.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper estimates the impact of reserve requirements (RR) on credit supply in Brazil, exploring a large loan-level dataset. We use a difference-in-difference strategy, first in a long panel, then in a cross-section. In the first case, we estimate the average effect on credit supply of several changes in RR from 2008 to 2015 using a macroprudential policy index. In the second, we use the bank-specific regulatory change to estimate credit supply responses from (1) a countercyclical easing policy implemented to alleviate a credit crunch in the aftermath of the 2008 global crisis; and (2) from its related tightening. We find evidence of a lending channel where more liquid banks mitigate RR policy. Exploring the two phases of countercyclical policy, we find that the easing impacted the lending channel on average two times more than the tightening. Foreign and small banks mitigate these effects. Finally, banks are prone to lend less to riskier firms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the impact on borrowers of loan-to-value (LTV) limits in Brazil, restricting the amount of credit that borrowers can take out. It considers two major housing finance segments. The first segment comprises housing loans directed mostly to middle-income households. The second segment targets low- and middle-income households. In particular, the study focuses on the subset of borrowers that are constrained by the policy. These borrowers would not comply with the LTV limit if allowed to do so. To do the analysis, the paper uses loan-level data on mortgages augmented with a detailed employment register.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Macroprudential policies related to housing finance represent a growing share of macroprudential tools. The objective of LTV limits for housing loans is to increase borrower resilience and to lower bank losses during downturns. However, the literature has not explored important transmission channels of LTV limits. Particularly, there is a lack of analysis at the loan level. This includes the effects of the policy on missed payment levels and on the choice of housing by families. This paper contributes to the literature by focusing on these changes on the behaviour of borrowers following the implementation of the LTV limit.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The results show that imposing LTV limits shifts several characteristics of the loan contract and influences borrowers´ behaviour. In both segments of housing finance, constrained borrowers end up meeting the new LTV limit. However, the impact on middle-income borrowers is greater.  In this segment, borrowers affected by the new regulation purchase more affordable houses. Moreover, these borrowers are less likely to be in arrears 12 months in the future. On the other hand, for borrowers of the second segment, there are no significant effects on housing choice or missed payments.</p>

</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
<p>This paper explores the effects on constrained borrowers of an LTV limit implemented on September 2013 on two major segments of housing finance in Brazil. LTV (hard) limits and related policies entail identification challenges, since constrained individuals are no longer directly observed after policy implementation. In this paper, partially observed treatment status is overcome by the use of an adjusted difference-in-difference method, focusing on the average treatment effect on the treated borrowers (i.e. those that would violate the LTV limit if allowed to do so). We use comprehensive loan-level data on mortgages augmented with a detailed and granular employment register. In the most affected segment, constrained individuals must meet the new LTV limit. These treated borrowers purchase more affordable homes and are less likely to be in arrears 12 months in the future. In the least affected segment, constrained borrowers also end-up meeting the new LTV limit, but the impacts are smaller and we find no significant effects on borrower's housing choice or morose debt.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper studies the effect of two macroprudential policies on firms' credit growth in Argentina for the period 2009-2014. The first policy required banks to reinvest part of their profits to increase their capital. The second policy set limits on the amount of assets and liabilities that financial institutions could hold in foreign currency. We analyse the effect of both the introduction and tightening of these policies.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Emerging markets are a natural starting place for studies on the effectiveness of macroprudential policies: they have implemented a wide variety of such measures; and these policies have been in place for a longer period than in advanced economies. In this sense, the study of the Argentine experience is worthwhile for policy design.  Moreover, most studies on the effects of macroprudential policies use data at the macro level. Our study is different in that it uses credit data available at the firm level. This allows the study of the impact of regulation on how banks grant credit to borrowers. Finally, most studies focus on measures that affect banks' capital, while we also look at those that affect their foreign currency position. This is relevant as currency-based measures are usual in emerging economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper finds that the implementation and tightening of both macroprudential policies were effective in reducing credit growth. Second, the limit on the foreign currency position of financial institutions appears to have had a more important impact. Third, these policies appear to have increased the quality of credit. Finally, bank characteristics such as the amount of assets and capital affect how financial institutions react to the policy change.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
<p>We aim to assess the impact of capital- and currency-based macroprudential policy measures on credit growth at the bank-firm level, using credit registry data from Argentina. We examine the impact of the introduction and tightening of a capital buffer and a limit on the foreign currency position of financial institutions on credit growth of firms, estimating fixed effects and difference-in-difference models for the period 2009-2014; we control for macroeconomic, financial institutions and firms' variables, both observable and unobservable. We find that: the capital buffer and the limits on foreign currency positions generally contribute to moderating the credit cycle, both when introduced and when tightened; the currency-based measure appears to have a quantitatively more important impact; both measures operate on the extensive and the intensive margins, and have an impact on credit supply. Macroprudential policies also have an effect on ex post credit quality: growth of non-performing loans is reduced after their implementation. In general, credit granted by banks with more capital and assets evidences a higher impact of the introduction of the capital buffer, while this measure also acts more strongly during economic activity expansions.</p>

<p><strong>Capital misallocation and financial development: a sector-level analysis</strong> (1:26)</p>
<p>Does financial development lead to a more efficient allocation of capital?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study whether financial development leads to a more efficient allocation of capital. Research indicates that countries are not poor because they invest too little but because they do not invest well. One reason could be that financial institutions and markets are underdeveloped. As a result, they are not able to identify good investment opportunities, provide financing and ensure a correct implementation of investments. This means that investment does not go where it is most productive. In turn, this reduces productivity and welfare.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>A large body of work supports the idea that financial development is good for growth. But we are not aware of any work on the link between such development and capital allocation efficiency. We fill this gap by calculating measures of capital allocation efficiency for six economies (China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico and the United States), going back for the most part to the early 1980s. We relate those measures to an index that captures various aspects of financial development. Unlike most of the relevant literature, we look at the allocation of capital and labour across economic sectors rather than across firms within one sector. This means, for example, that we want to know whether physical capital is concentrated in the less productive construction industry or the more productive IT industry, and not whether less productive construction firm A invests more than the more productive construction firm B. Our analysis uses data on output and labour and capital inputs for 26 sectors of our target economies.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our results support the idea that financial development is associated with a more efficient allocation of capital. In more developed financial systems, higher investment tends to go hand in hand with a better allocation of capital. In less developed financial systems, the opposite is true: higher investment goes to less productive sectors and capital allocation is worse. Not surprisingly, industries that undertake more research and development or rely more on external funding to finance investment benefit most from financial development.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This study investigates how financial development affects capital allocation across industries in a panel of countries at different stages of development (China, India, Mexico, Korea, Japan and the US) over the period 1980-2014. Following the approach proposed by Chari et al (2007) and Aoki (2012), we compute wedges for capital and labour inputs for 26 industrial sectors in the six countries and add them up to economy-wide measures of capital and labour misallocation. We find that more developed financial systems allocate capital investment more efficiently than less developed ones. If financial development is low, faster capital accumulation is associated with a worsening of allocative efficiency. This effect reverses for higher levels of financial development. Sectors with high R&amp;D expenditures or high capital investment benefit most from financial development. These effects are not only statistically significant, they are also large in economic terms.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>The paper examines two possible objectives - macroprudential or trade competitiveness - with which policymakers in emerging market economies (EMEs) may have used capital controls.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>There is surprisingly little factual evidence concerning the objective with which capital controls have been used in EMEs. The paper attempts to answer this question by using an approach based on a policy reaction function.<br/>The paper also proposes a new measure of an EME's real currency appreciation against its main trade competitors as a way of disentangling macroprudential and competitiveness motivations.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>The paper uses a weekly data set on capital controls that directly quantifies the actions taken by 21 major EMEs over the period 2001-15. It finds that the assumed policy reaction function traces successfully the systematic pattern behind the tools' use. Moreover, the adoption of tightening measures on net capital inflows seems to be consistent with both macroprudential and competitiveness motivations.<br/>While the results suggest that capital controls did target systemic risk, they also indicate that the measures did not necessarily target systemic risk arising from excessive foreign borrowing. Rather, it appears that controls on foreign credit were tightened when domestic bank credit to the private non-financial sector was booming, and vice versa. That said, the development of governance arrangements for macroprudential policy has led to a more predictable response of capital controls to systemic risk concerns.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper attempts to borrow the tradition of estimating policy reaction functions in monetary policy literature and apply it to capital controls policy literature. Using a novel weekly dataset on capital controls policy actions in 21 emerging economies over the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2015, I examine the competitiveness and macroprudential motivations for capital control policies. I introduce a new proxy for competitiveness motivations: the weighted appreciation of an emerging-market currency against its top five trade competitors. The analysis shows that past emerging-market policy systematically responds to both competitiveness and macroprudential motivations. The choice of instruments is also systematic: policy-makers respond to competitiveness concerns by using both instruments - inflow tightening and outflow easing. They use only inflow tightening in response to macroprudential concerns. I also find evidence that that policy is acyclical to foreign debt but is countercyclical to domestic bank credit to the private non-financial sector. The adoption of explicit financial stability mandates by central banks or the creation of inter-agency financial stability councils increased the weight of macroprudential factors in the use of capital controls policies. Countries with higher exchange rate pass-through to export prices are more responsive to competitiveness concerns.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper explores the extent and consequences of credit misallocation in Italy during and after the euro zone crisis, addressing two main questions: (i) What bank characteristics are more conducive to zombie lending? (ii) What is the cost of zombie lending in terms of lost economic activity and misallocation of real resources?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>An important dimension of financial crises is a weakened banking sector. There is a widespread perception in the policy debate that undercapitalised banks can prolong crises by misallocating credit to weaker firms on the verge of bankruptcy and by restraining credit to healthy borrowers ("zombie lending").</p>
<p>The paper investigates the presence of zombie lending and its consequences using detailed micro data at the bank and firm level to control for demand effects, isolating a credit supply channel. Next, it tests whether a high share of credit from low-capital banks - those that distort credit towards zombie firms - in the local market harms the performance of healthy firms.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Undercapitalised banks were less likely to cut credit to zombie firms.</p>
<p>Credit misallocation increased the failure rate of healthy firms and lowered the failure rate of zombie firms.</p>
<p>However, the adverse effects of credit misallocation on the growth rate of healthy firms were modest, as were the effects on total factor productivity (TFP) dispersion.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Do banks with low capital extend excessive credit to weak firms, and does this matter for aggregate efficiency? Using a unique dataset that covers almost all bank-firm relationships in Italy in the period 2004-2013, we find that during the Eurozone financial crisis (i) undercapitalized banks were less likely to cut credit to non-viable firms; (ii) credit misallocation increased the failure rate of healthy firms and reduced the failure rate of non-viable firms and (iii) nevertheless, the adverse effects of credit misallocation on the growth rate of healthier firms were negligible, as were the effects on TFP dispersion. This goes against previous influential findings, which, we argue, face serious identification problems. Thus, while banks with low capital can be an important source of aggregate inefficiency in the long run, their contribution to the severity of the great recession via capital misallocation was modest.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper assesses the impact of shocks on Latin American economies and compares the effects of policies in four commodity-exporting countries in Latin America (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). Among the questions addressed are: (1) What are the effects of real and financial shocks in these countries? (2) How far do financial shocks explain investment and output growth? (3) How effective are monetary and macroprudential policies in reacting to real and financial shocks?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Our paper makes two contributions. First, by including two key sectors (commodity exports and a domestic financial sector), our model provides a unique framework to compare the effects of financial shocks while also capturing differences across the countries. Second, we compare the use and effectiveness of macroprudential policies in Latin America.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find that financial shocks partly explain investment and output growth in the short run but less so in the long run. Our results also suggest that macroprudential policies are effective for restoring credit and output growth in periods of financial contraction or tighter monetary policy. They are less effective in periods of low commodity prices.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This work compares the impact of monetary and macroprudential policies on financial and real sectors in four Latin American countries: Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, and explores the commonalities and differences in the reaction to shocks to both the financial and real sector. In order to do that, we estimate a New Keynesian small open economy model with frictions in the domestic financial intermediation sector and a commodity sector for each country. Results suggest that financial shocks are important drivers of output and investment fluctuations in the short run for most countries, but in the long run their contribution is small. Furthermore, we evaluate the ability of macroprudential policies to limit the impact on credit growth and its effect on real variables. In a scenario of tighter financial conditions, monetary policy becomes expansionary due to both lower inflation (given the exchange rate appreciation) and weaker output growth, and macroprudential policies further contribute to restoring credit and output growth. However, in the case of a negative commodity price shock, macroprudential policies are less effective but useful as a complement for the tightening of monetary policy. Higher inflation (due to the exchange rate depreciation) and higher policy rates lead to a contraction in output growth, but macroprudential policies could alleviate this by improving credit conditions.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Forward-looking monetary policy relies not only on forecasts of variables like economic growth and inflation, but must also assess and communicate the uncertainty around those forecasts. Often, forecast uncertainty is depicted with 'fan' charts that predict a range in which future data are likely to fall.</p>
<p>Surveys regularly provide data on economic forecasts. But survey respondents do not always provide quantitative measures of forecast uncertainty. Instead, uncertainty can be gauged based on past forecast performance. When doing so, the distribution of forecast errors is typically assumed to have remained unchanged for at least a decade. Fan charts are then slow to adapt when the size of the errors shifts, as it did during the 1980s or the recent financial crisis.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>We model uncertainty around survey forecasts. Our model tracks changes in the range of likely outcomes better than an approach that simply averages over the last two decades or so. A simple average puts equal weight on all data points in a given subsample, dropping some early data points which may be less relevant in assessing forecast uncertainty later on. Our model considers all the data available from a given survey, but weighs them differently. Our estimates put more weight on the recent past than a simple average over 15 years.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We apply our model to forecasts for economic growth, unemployment, inflation and nominal short-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters. Fan charts from our model predict the range of future forecast errors better than the simple-average approach. We find similar results when we apply our model to staff forecasts published by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We develop uncertainty measures for point forecasts from surveys such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters, Blue Chip, or the Federal Open Market Committee's Summary of Economic Projections. At a given point of time, these surveys provide forecasts for macroeconomic variables at multiple horizons. To track time-varying uncertainty in the associated forecast errors, we derive a multiple-horizon speci cation of stochastic volatility. Compared to constant-variance approaches, our stochastic-volatility model improves the accuracy of uncertainty measures for survey forecasts.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>We study how different constraints on banks' activities affect the allocation of capital across business units. In particular, we look at the interplay of risk-based and leverage-based constraints on banks' lending and market-making.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The paper underscores that internal capital reallocation should be taken into account when assessing the combined impact of regulation, internal risk management and risk perceptions on banks' behaviour. This is because capital reallocation creates links between seemingly separate business units of a bank holding company. For instance, a change in regulatory standards, a stress test or an actual tightening of financial conditions that directly affects only lending would spill over to market-making.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Our model establishes general patterns for banks' response to higher perceived risk, stricter regulation or more demanding risk management. When financial conditions tighten, capital becomes scarcer and the bank needs to shrink. In the process, capital flows internally to the unit that has become more profitable under the new conditions: the more efficient unit. We derive that larger and less risky units, or those with revenues more sensitive to downsizing, tend to be more efficient.</p>
<p>To show the knock-on effects of capital reallocation, we benchmark the model to data from large US banks. At the benchmark, the market-making unit is more efficient. Thus, market-making attracts capital and lending shrinks, irrespective of whether credit or market risk rises. For credit risk below its benchmark value, tighter leverage constraints may reduce market-making but support lending. These spillovers occur even when business units face independent risks and separate constraints. They result from centralised decision-making within a bank holding company.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Banks allocate capital across business units while facing multiple constraints that may bind contemporaneously or only in future states. When risks rise or risk management strengthens, a bank reallocates capital to the more efficient unit. This unit would have generated higher constraint- and risk-adjusted returns while satisfying a tightened constraint at the old capital allocation. Calibrated to US data, our model reveals that, when credit or market risk increases, market-making attracts capital and lending shrinks. Leverage constraints affect banks only when measured risks are low. At low credit risk, tighter leverage constraints may reduce market-making but support lending.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper shows how interest rates affect house prices. We look at the effects of short-term and long-term interest rates, in the United States and 46 other advanced and emerging market economies, over the period from 1970 to 2015. We use data that statistical agencies in those countries picked as their preferred measures of house price inflation. We assess the impact on house prices of interest rates and other demand variables (income, employment) with the aid of standard statistical single- and multi-country (so-called panel) regressions.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>The link between interest rates and house prices is of longstanding interest to economists. One novelty of our study is that we assess the impact on house prices of short-term interest rates, which are closely linked to monetary policy. Previous studies have looked mainly at the impact of long-term rates. Another novelty is that we look at how house prices outside the United States have responded not just to domestic but also to US interest rates. With the spread of capital flows, the latter have become a measure of the worldwide cost of funding for banks around the world. We have followed two other approaches that differ from existing studies. First, the data set mentioned above. Second, the attention we give to inertia in house prices, ie the tendency for past changes in house prices to influence those we see today.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We find a surprisingly important role for short-term interest rates as drivers of house prices, especially outside the United States. We also find that changes in short-term interest rates from up to five years in the past can have a strong influence on changes in house prices today. In addition, we find a strong link between US interest rates and changes in house prices in other countries. Studies that treat housing as a form of investment whose alternative is renting property predict much higher interest rate sensitivity of house prices than those we obtain. However, our estimates are much higher than those that neglect the role of inertia in house prices.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper estimates the response of house prices to changes in short- and long-term interest rates in 47 advanced and emerging market economies. We use data that statistical authorities selected as their best house price series, covering almost half a century of quarterly observations for the United States and over 1,000 annual observations for the rest of the sample. We find a surprisingly important role for short-term interest rates as a driver of house prices, especially outside the United States. Our interpretation is that this reflects the importance of the bank lending channel of monetary policy in house price fluctuations, especially in countries where securitisation of home mortgages is less prevalent. In addition, we document substantial inertia in house prices and find that changes in interest rates and other determinants affect house prices gradually rather than on impact. This suggests that modest cuts in policy rates are not likely to rapidly fuel house price increases. Finally, we find that US interest rates seem to affect house prices outside the United States.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>How can mutual funds manage the liquidity risks they are exposed to? We study funds' use of swing pricing, an innovative liquidity management tool, which is being allowed in a growing number of jurisdictions and will be introduced in the United States in 2018.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Investment in mutual funds has been growing at an exceptional pace over the past few years, with possible implications for financial stability. This warrants increased attention on how funds manage risks. For open-end mutual funds, a key risk stems from unexpected redemptions: Investors can redeem their fund shares at short notice, which may force the fund to sell assets. Yet these assets can be difficult to liquidate, particularly under stressed market conditions. We assess how funds can manage this risk using "swing pricing". Swing pricing allows a fund to reduce the payout to investors when redemptions are large. This, in principle, discourages investors from selling out at short notice - but little is known about how effective the tool is in practice.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>We assess the effects of swing pricing by comparing open-end bond funds in Luxembourg, where swing pricing is allowed, with similar funds in the United States, where it is not. We find that, during normal times, flows out of Luxembourg funds are less sensitive to bad fund performance than those out of US funds not using swing pricing. This tallies with the expected impact of swing pricing on investor incentives. Yet during periods of market stress, such as the 2013 US taper tantrum, we find no such effect. One possible reason is that funds do not use the tool enough to discourage withdrawals during times of stress. We also show that Luxembourg funds benefited from higher returns during the taper tantrum, as expected, although prices were more volatile. In addition, we find that Luxembourg funds tend to hold less cash than their US counterparts, since swing pricing acts as a substitute for maintaining high reserves. This reduces the stabilising effect of swing pricing, but regulators could offset this through other measures.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>How effective are available policy tools in managing liquidity risks in the mutual fund industry? We assess one such tool - swing pricing - which allows funds to adjust their settlement price in response to large net flows. Our empirical analysis exploits the fact that swing pricing is available to Luxembourg funds, but not yet to U.S. funds. We show that swing pricing dampens outflows in reaction to weak fund performance, but has a limited effect during stress episodes. Furthermore, swing pricing supports fund returns, while raising accounting volatility, and may lead to lower cash buffers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>Can swing pricing, an innovative fund management tool, reduce the redemption risk for open-end mutual funds? How does it affect the liquidity risks of fund investors?</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Open-end mutual funds are exposed to liquidity risks: they allow investors to redeem their fund shares at short notice, but their own investments are in less liquid assets to earn a return. If investor redemptions are large, the fund needs to sell assets. This is costly and dilutes the value of the fund, hurting investors that stay the course. Funds need to ensure they have enough protection against liquidity risks because, otherwise, investor behaviour could trigger asset price declines and amplify financial crises. We assess the role of "swing pricing", how the fund should best apply it, and whether this helps to insure against liquidity risks.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Within a theoretical model, we study how a fund should set the price for investors that want to redeem shares or subscribe to new shares, and how much cash the fund should hold. We find that the best results are achieved if the fund lowers the price when redemptions are large, charging to redeeming investors at least some of the trading costs that the fund incurs. The higher the fund's trading costs, the lower the settlement price. Correspondingly, the fund raises the price if redemptions and trading costs are low or when it experiences inflows. That said, the difference between the optimal settlement price and the market price of the fund's assets remains relatively small. This is to discourage costly arbitrage trades that aim to exploit a large difference between the two prices. The fund should also hold a large enough cash buffer to meet expected redemptions. We argue that swing pricing might help ease the risk of self-fulfilling runs on funds.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Open-end mutual funds expose themselves to liquidity risk by granting their investors the right to daily redemptions at the fund's net asset value. We assess how swing pricing can dampen such risks by allowing the fund to settle investor orders at a price below the fund's net asset value. This reduces investors' incentive to redeem shares and mitigates the risk of large destabilising outflows.Optimal swing pricing balances this risk with the benefit of providing liquidity to cash-constrained investors. We derive bounds, depending on trading costs and the share of liquidity-constrained investors, within which a fund chooses to swing the settlement price. We also show how the optimal settlement price responds to unanticipated shocks. Finally, we discuss whether swing pricing can help mitigate the risk of self-fulfilling runs on funds.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper tests whether longer relationships between banks and their clients have a real impact on firms' behaviour. In particular, we study whether firms with longer banking relationships invested more in physical capital and employed more workers than other firms during the crisis.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>Building strong relationships with lenders can help firms as banks have an incentive to keep lending to firms they know well, even if they are experiencing temporary difficulties. This paper goes further than the usual focus on whether these longer relationships affect the amount and price of credit by analysing the effects on corporate decisions to invest or employ workers.</p>
<p>We also explore whether the support provided by banking relationships is different when the banking system faces a fundamental or systemic shock. We study this by comparing the effects of relationship lending after the European sovereign debt crisis and after the Lehman default shock. The former directly threatened both the Italian economy and the banking system, while the latter only had an indirect effect on banks, largely through the interbank market.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Using very detailed data, we find that following Lehman's default, banks offered more favourable lending terms to firms with which they had stronger relationships. Such favourable conditions help firms maintain higher levels of investment and employment. The insulation effects of tighter bank-firm relationships were still present during the European sovereign debt crisis, especially for firms tied to well capitalised banks.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper studies the real consequences of relationship lending on firm activity in Italy following Lehman Brothers' default shock and Europe's sovereign debt crisis. We use a large data set that merges the comprehensive Italian Credit and Firm Registers. We find that following Lehman's default, banks offered more favourable continuation lending terms to firms with which they had stronger relationships. Such favourable conditions enabled firms to maintain higher levels of investment and employment. The insulation effects of tighter bank-firm relationships was still present during the European sovereign debt crisis, especially for firms tied to well capitalised banks.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4>Focus</h4>
<p>This paper seeks to measure the importance of the Global Financial Cycle for explaining international capital flows. Hélène Rey and others have argued that capital flows move in unison across countries. They put forward that this is because of financial conditions in key advanced countries - or "centre countries" - such as the United States.</p>
<h4>Contribution</h4>
<p>This paper tests the thesis of Rey and others using various statistical techniques. The quantitative importance of the Global Financial Cycle for capital flows is of crucial importance for smaller open economies, including many emerging and developing economies.</p>
<p>If the argument is correct, this may lead small open economies to try to shield themselves from disruptive capital flows. Countries may choose to insulate themselves from global financial markets with capital controls or macroprudential policies. Or they may build up plentiful foreign currency reserves as a buffer.</p>
<p>But if the argument is not correct, it suggests policies that seek to screen "good" from "bad" capital flows are not useful. If the country tries to insulate itself from such flows, it may give up the gains of international financial integration.</p>
<h4>Findings</h4>
<p>Using a range of techniques, we find little evidence that the Global Financial Cycle plays a significant role in capital flows. Specifically, we find that the Global Financial Cycle rarely explains more than a quarter of capital flow variation.</p>
<p>We are aware of pitfalls. We use conventional models of capital flows estimated in simple ways with standard data and evaluated with traditional statistics. Future work could extend this in many ways.</p>
<p>We also focus only on the impact of the Global Financial Cycle on capital flows. However, the Global Financial Cycle could affect other important variables, such as domestic asset prices or credit.</p>
<div class="hr">
    
</div>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This study quantifies the importance of a Global Financial Cycle (GFCy) for capital flows. We use capital flow data disaggregated by direction and type between Q1 1990 and Q4 2015 for 85 countries, and conventional techniques, models and metrics. Since the GFCy is an unobservable concept, we use two methods to represent it: directly observable variables in centre economies often linked to it, such as the VIX; and indirect manifestations, proxied by common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows. Our evidence seems mostly inconsistent with a significant and conspicuous GFCy; the two methods combined rarely explain more than a quarter of the variation in capital flows. Succinctly, most variation in capital flows does not seem to be the result of common shocks nor stem from observables in a central country like the United States.</p>

<p>This paper develops a new theoretical model with an asymmetric informal one-sided exchange rate target zone, with an application to the Swiss franc following the removal of the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro in January 2015. We extend and generalize the standard target zone model of Krugman (1991) by introducing perceived uncertainty about the lower edge of the band. We find that informal soft edge target zone bands lead to weaker honeymoon effects, wider target zone ranges and higher exchange rate volatility than formal target zone bands. These results suggest that it would be beneficial for exchange rate policy intentions to be stated clearly in order to anchor exchange rate expectations and reduce exchange rate volatility. We also study how exchange rate dynamics can be characterized in models in which financial markets are aware of occasional changes in the policy regime. We show that expected changes in the central bank's exchange rate policy may lead to exchange rate oscillations, providing an additional source of exchange rate volatility, and to capture this it is important to take into account the possibility of regime changes in exchange rate policy.</p>

<p>The literature on capital controls has focused on their use as tools to manage capital and improve macroeconomic and financial stability. However, there is a lack of analysis of their effect on foreign exchange (FX) market liquidity. In particular, technological and regulatory changes in FX markets over the past decade have had an influence on the effect of capital controls on alternative indicators of FX liquidity.</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a theoretical model showing that, if capital controls are modelled as entry costs, then fewer investors will enter an economy. This will reduce the market's ability to accommodate large order flows without a significant change in the exchange rate (a market depth measure of liquidity). On the other hand, if capital controls are modelled as transaction costs, they can reduce the effective spread (a cost-based measure of liquidity). Using a panel of 20 emerging market economies and a novel measure of capital account restrictiveness, we provide empirical evidence showing that capital controls can reduce cost-based measures of FX market liquidity. The results imply that capital controls are effective in reducing the implicit cost component of FX market liquidity but can also have a negative structural effect on the FX market by making it more vulnerable to order flow imbalances.</p>

<p>The empirical gravity literature finds geographical distance to be a large and growing obstacle to trade, contradicting the popular notion that globalization heralds "the end of geography". This distance puzzle disappears, however, when measuring the effect of cross-border distance relative to that of domestic distance (Yotov, 2012). We uncover the same result for banking when comparing cross-border positions with domestic credit, using the most extensive dataset on global bank linkages between countries. The role of distance remains substantial for trade as well as for banking where transport cost is immaterial - pointing to the role of information frictions as a common driver. A second contribution is to show that the forces of globalization are also evident in other, less prominent, parts of the gravity framework.</p>

<p>This paper analyses firm's pricing-to-market decisions in vertically differentiated industries. We first present a model featuring firms that sell goods of heterogeneous quality levels to consumers who are heterogeneous in their income and thus their marginal willingness to pay for quality increments. We derive closed-form solutions for the unique pricing game under costly international trade. The comparative statics highlight how firms' pricing-to-market decisions are shaped by the interaction of consumer income and good quality. We derive two testable predictions.

<p>Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the largest ever positive labour supply shock occurred, resulting from demographic trends and from the inclusion of China and eastern Europe into the World Trade Organization. This led to a shift in manufacturing to Asia, especially China; a stagnation in real wages; a collapse in the power of private sector trade unions; increasing inequality within countries, but less inequality between countries; deflationary pressures; and falling interest rates. This shock is now reversing. As the world ages, real interest rates will rise, inflation and wage growth will pick up and inequality will fall. What is the biggest challenge to our thesis? The hardest prior trend to reverse will be that of low interest rates, which have resulted in a huge and persistent debt overhang, apart from some deleveraging in advanced economy banks. Future problems may now intensify as the demographic structure worsens, growth slows, and there is little stomach for major inflation. Are we in a trap where the debt overhang enforces continuing low interest rates, and those low interest rates encourage yet more debt finance? There is no silver bullet, but we recommend policy measures to switch from debt to equity finance.</p>

<p>This paper reviews various issues linked to the rise of inequality observed particularly in developed countries over the last quarter century. Various data on the time profile of inequality are examined, which do not always fit the common view that inequality is everywhere trending upwards. Overall, changes in inequality appear to be very country-specific. The same conclusion obtains when examining the causes of these changes. There is little doubt that common forces affected the distribution of income in most countries, but idiosyncratic factors have amplified their effects in some cases and offset them in others. Country-specificity also holds with regard to policies aimed at correcting inequality, even though globalisation imposes constraints on some key redistribution tools such as taxation and the regulation of financial markets. International coordination and, in particular, more transparency in cross-border financial operations are needed if governments are to recover some autonomy in these matters.</p>

<p>A country's exchange rate is at the center of economic and political debates on currency wars and trade competitiveness. The real consequences of exchange rate fluctuations depend critically on how firms set prices in international markets. Recent empirical evidence has challenged the dominant 'producer currency' pricing and 'local currency' pricing paradigms in the literature. In this paper we propose a new paradigm, consistent with the empirical evidence and characterized by three features: pricing in dollars, strategic complementarity in pricing and imported inputs in production. We call this the 'dollar pricing' paradigm and contrast its theoretical predictions with prior approaches in a general equilibrium New Keynesian model. We then employ novel data for Colombia to evaluate the implications of exchange rate fluctuations associated with commodity price shocks and show that the findings strongly support the dollar pricing paradigm.</p>

<p>This paper studies the violation of the most basic no-arbitrage condition in international finance - Covered Interest Parity (CIP). To understand the CIP conundrum, it is key to (i) account for funding frictions in U.S. dollar money markets, and (ii) to study the challenges of swap intermediaries when funding liquidity evolves differently across major currency areas. We find that CIP holds remarkably well for most potential arbitrageurs when applying their marginal funding rates. With severe funding liquidity differences, however, it becomes impossible for dealers to quote prices such that CIP holds across the full rate spectrum. A narrow set of global top-tier banks enjoys risk-less arbitrage opportunities as dealers set quotes to avert order flow imbalances. We show how a situation with persistent arbitrage profits arises as an equilibrium outcome due to the constellation of market segmentation, the abundance of excess reserves and their remuneration in central banks' deposit facilities.</p>

<p>This paper argues that the decline in cross-border banking since 2007 does not amount to a broad-based retreat in international lending ("financial deglobalisation"). We show that BIS international banking data organised by the nationality of ownership ("consolidated view") provide a clearer picture of international financial integration than the traditional balance-of-payments measure. On the consolidated view, what appears to be a global shrinkage of international banking is confined to European banks, which uniquely responded to credit losses after 2007 by shedding assets abroad - in particular, reducing lending - to restore capital ratios. Other banking systems' global footprint, notably those of Japanese, Canadian and even US banks, has expanded since 2007. Using a global dataset of banks' affiliates (branches and subsidiaries), we demonstrate that <em>the who </em>(nationality) accounts for more of the peak-to-trough shrinkage of foreign claims than does <em>the where </em>(locational factors). These findings suggest that the contraction in global lending can be interpreted as cyclical deleveraging of European banks' large overseas operations, rather than broad-based financial deglobalisation.</p>

<p>This study shows that, in the United States, the effects of monetary policy on credit and housing markets have become considerably stronger relative to the impact on GDP since the mid-1980s, while the effects on inflation have become weaker. Macroeconomic stabilization through monetary policy may therefore have become associated with greater fluctuations in credit and housing markets, whereas stabilizing credit and house prices may have become less costly in terms of macroeconomic volatility. These changes in the aggregate impact of monetary policy can be explained by several important changes in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the composition of macroeconomic and credit aggregates. In particular, the stronger impact of monetary policy on credit is driven by a much higher responsiveness of mortgage credit and a larger share of mortgages in total credit since the 1980s.</p>

We focus our analysis on the firms that have ratings from both domestic and global agencies. Despite the similar symbols, the rating scales of the domestic and global agencies differ: domestic agencies rate firms that are jointly rated higher than global agencies by 6-7 notches on average. Focusing on the rank order of domestic and global credit ratings, we test for differences in the determinants of ratings across global and domestic agencies. We find asset size is weighed more heavily as a positive factor by domestic agencies, and leverage is weighed more heavily as a negative factor by global agencies. Profitability and state-ownership are weighed more positively by global rating agencies. The influence of the variables is generally stable across a variety of robustness checks.

Fitting the model with forecaster-level data for Japan, we find that the estimated anchors across forecasters have tended to rise in recent years, along with the dispersion in estimates across forecasters. Further, the degree to which these anchors pin down inflation expectations at longer horizons has increased, but remains considerably lower than found in a similar study of Canadian and US forecasters. Finally, the wide dispersion in estimated decay paths across forecasters points to a diverse set of views across forecasters about the inflation process in Japan.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the effects of macroprudential policies on bank risk through a large panel of banks operating in 61 advanced and emerging market economies. There are three main findings. First, there is evidence suggesting that macroprudential tools have a significant impact on bank risk. Second, the responses to changes in macroprudential tools differ among banks, depending on their specific balance sheet characteristics. In particular, banks that are small, weakly capitalised and with a higher share of wholesale funding react more strongly to changes in macroprudential tools. Third, controlling for bank-specific characteristics, macroprudential policies are more effective in a tightening than in an easing episode.</p>

<p align="LEFT">When taking on new debt, borrowers commit to a pre-specified path of future debt service. This implies a predictable lag between credit booms and peaks in debt service which, in a panel of household debt in 17 countries, is four years on average. The lag is driven by two key features of the data: (i) new borrowing is strongly auto-correlated and (ii) debt contracts are long term. The delayed increase in debt service following an impulse to new borrowing largely explains why credit booms are associated with lower future output growth and higher probability of crisis. This provides a systematic transmission channel whereby credit expansions can have long-lasting adverse real effects.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The post-crisis period has seen a considerable shift in the composition and drivers of international bank lending and international bond issuance, the two main components of global liquidity. The sensitivity of both types of flow to US monetary policy rose substantially in the immediate aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, peaked around the time of the 2013 Fed "taper tantrum", and then partially reverted towards pre-crisis levels. Conversely, the responsiveness of international bank lending to global risk conditions declined considerably post-crisis and became similar to that of international debt securities. The increased sensitivity of international bank flows to US monetary policy has been driven mainly by post-crisis changes in the behaviour of national lending banking systems, especially those that ex ante had less well capitalized banks. By contrast, the post-crisis fall in the sensitivity of international bank lending to global risk was mainly due to a compositional effect, driven by increases in the lending market shares of better-capitalized national banking systems. The post-2013 reversal in the sensitivities to US monetary policy partially reflects the expected divergence of the monetary policy of the US and other advanced economies, highlighting the sensitivity of capital flows to the degree of commonality of cycles and the stance of policy. Moreover, global liquidity fluctuations have largely been driven by policy initiatives in creditor countries. Policies and prudential instruments that reinforced lending banks' capitalization and stable funding levels reduced the volatility of international lending flows.</p>

<p>The large economic costs associated with the Global Financial Crisis have generated renewed interest in macroprudential policies and their international coordination. Based on a core-periphery model that emphasizes the role of international financial centers, we study the effects of coordinated and non-coordinated macroprudential policies when financial intermediation is subject to frictions. We find that even when the only frictions in the economy consist of financial frictions and financial dependency of periphery banks, the policy prescriptions under international policy coordination can differ quite markedly from those emerging from self-oriented policy decisions. Optimal macroprudential policies must address both short run and long run inefficiencies. In the short run, the policy instruments need to be adjusted to mitigate the adverse consequences of the financial accelerator, and its cross-country spillovers. In the long run, policymakers need to take into account the effects of the higher cost of capital, due to the presence of financial frictions. The gains from cooperation appear to be sizable. Nevertheless, their magnitude could be asymmetric, pointing to potential political-economy obstacles to the implementation of cooperative measures.</p>

<p>The impacts of monetary easing on inequality have been attracting increasing attention recently. In this paper, we use the micro-level data on Japanese households to study the distributional effects of monetary policy. We construct quarterly series of income and consumption inequality measures from 1981 to 2008, and estimate their response to a monetary policy shock. We find that monetary policy shocks do not have a statistically significant impact on inequality across Japanese households in a stable manner. When considering inequality across households whose head is employed, we find evidence that, before the 2000s, an expansionary monetary policy shock increased income inequality through a rise in earnings inequality. Such procyclical responses are, however, scarcely observed when the current data are included in the sample period, or when earnings inequality across all households is considered. We also find that transmission of income inequality to consumption inequality is minor, including during the period when procyclicality of income inequality was pronounced. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with attached labor inputs, we show that labor market flexibility is central to the dynamics of income inequality after monetary policy shocks. We also use the micro-level data on households' balance sheets and show that distributions of households' financial assets and liabilities do not play a significant role in the distributional effects of monetary policy.</p>

<p>This paper aims to enhance the understanding of China's monetary policy rule since the mid-1990s, focusing on the role of inflation. It investigates the rule followed by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) by considering both the structural economic transformation of China and its evolving monetary policy framework.</p>
<p>Our newly constructed monthly composite discrete monetary policy index (MPI), which combines price, quantity and administrative instruments, shows a change in style towards smoother but more contractionary policy moves from 2002 onwards. The estimation of a dynamic discrete-choice model à la Monokroussos (2011) implies that, from this point onwards, the conduct of monetary policy has been characterised by implicit inflation targeting. While the PBoC's behaviour up to 2001 was reminiscent of that in the inflation-accommodating G3 economies of the United States, euro area and Japan up to 1979, it has been characterized since 2002 by a policy rule similar to the post-1979 anti-inflation (forward-looking) policy of the G3. An accurate estimation of the monetary policy rule from 2002 needs to consider China as an open economy, as a result of its rapid liberalisation of trade and finance after its WTO accession. As such, the influence of US interest rates has become increasingly significant for Chinese monetary policy.</p>

In a representative panel of households, we find that people in the bottom decile of noncognitive abilities are five times more likely to experience financial distress compared to those in the top decile. Relatedly, individuals with lower noncognitive abilities make financial choices that increase their likelihood of distress: They are less likely to plan for retirement and save, and more likely to buy impulsively and to have unsecured debt. Causality is shown using childhood trauma as an instrument.</p>

<p>What is the role for supply and demand forces in determining movements in international banking flows? Answering this question is crucial for understanding the international transmission of financial shocks and formulating policy. This paper addresses the question by using the method developed in Amiti and Weinstein (forthcoming) to exactly decompose the growth in international bank credit into common shocks, idiosyncratic supply shocks and idiosyncratic demand shocks for the period 2000-2016. A striking feature of the global banking flows data can be characterized by what we term the "Anna Karenina Principle": all healthy credit relationships are alike, each unhealthy credit relationship is unhealthy in its own way. During non-crisis years, bank flows are well-explained by a common global factor and a local demand factor. But during times of crisis flows are affected by idiosyncratic supply shocks to a borrower country's creditor banks. This has important implications for why standard models break down during crises.</p>

We do so by investigating the impact of financial and commodity price cycles on the identification of episodes of fiscal consolidation and stimulus and the size of the fiscal impulse. We find that controlling for the credit cycle has an impact on the magnitude of the change in the cyclically-adjusted budget balance. The impact is lower in the case of the commodity price cycle. In addition, we show that credit booms and busts influence the cyclicality of fiscal policy, but not to the extent of significantly altering the systematic response of fiscal policy to the dynamics of real economic activity. Again, the impact of the commodity price cycle is smaller and limited to some specific cases.</p>

Moreover, because different sectors within a country participate in international production sharing at different stages, sector level variations are also important for determining competitiveness.

<p>This paper summarises the results of a joint research project by eight central banks in the Americas region to evaluate the effectiveness of macroprudential tools and their interaction with monetary policy. In particular, using meta-analysis techniques, we summarise the results for five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) that use confidential bank-loan data. The use of granular credit registry data helps us to disentangle loan demand from loan supply effects without making strong assumptions. Results from another three countries (Canada, Chile and the United States) corroborate the analysis using data for credit origination and borrower characteristics. The main conclusions are that (i) macroprudential policies have been quite effective in stabilising credit cycles. The propagation of the effects to credit growth is more rapid (they materialise after one quarter) for policies aimed at curbing the cycle than for policies aimed at fostering resilience (which take effect within a year); and (ii) macroprudential tools have a greater effect on credit growth when reinforced by the use of monetary policy to push in the same direction.</p>

<p>We analyze how two types of recently used prudential policies affected the supply of credit in the United States. First, we test whether the U.S. bank stress tests had any impact on the supply of mortgage credit. We find that the first Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test in 2011 had a negative effect on the share of jumbo mortgage originations and approval rates at stress-tested banks-banks with worse capital positions were impacted more negatively. Second, we analyze the impact of the 2013 Supervisory Guidance on Leveraged Lending and subsequent 2014 FAQ notice, which clarified expectations on the Guidance. We find that the share of speculative-grade term-loan originations decreased notably at regulated banks after the FAQ notice.</p>

<p>Macroprudential tools have been used around the world to counter potential risks and imbalances in the financial sector. Colombia is a good example of a country that has employed a variety of regulatory measures to manage systemic risks in the economy. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of two such policies with a view to increasing systemic resilience and curbing excesses in the credit supply. The first measure, the countercyclical reserve requirement, was implemented in 2007 to control excessive credit growth. The second was the dynamic provisioning scheme for commercial loans, which was designed to establish a countercyclical buffer through loan loss provision requirements. To perform this analysis, a rich dataset based on loan-by-loan information for Colombian banks during the 2006-09 period is used. A fixed effects panel model is estimated using the characteristics of debtors, banks and the macroeconomy as control variables. In addition, a difference in differences estimation is performed to evaluate the policies' impact. The findings suggest that the dynamic provisions and the countercyclical reserve requirement had a negative effect on credit growth, and that this effect varies according to bank-specific characteristics. Results also suggest that the aggregate macroprudential policy stance in Colombia has worked effectively to stabilize credit cycles, with some preliminary evidence also pointing towards significant effects in reducing bank risk-taking. Moreover, evidence is found that macroprudential policies have worked as a complement to monetary policy, as both have a moderating effect on credit growth when tightened.</p>

<p>We find evidence that in the market for euro area sovereign credit risk, arbitrageurs engage in basis trades between credit default swap (CDS) and bond markets only when the CDS-bond basis exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold effect is likely to reflect costs that arbitrageurs face when implementing trading strategies, including transaction costs and costs associated with committing balance sheet space for such trades. Using a threshold vector error correction model, we endogenously estimate these unknown trading costs for basis trades in the market for euro area sovereign debt. During the euro sovereign credit crisis, we find very high transaction costs of around 190 basis points, compared to around 80 basis points before the crisis. Our results show, that even when markets in times of stress are liquid, the basis can widen as high market volatility makes arbitrage trades riskier, leading arbitrageurs to demand a higher compensation for increased risk. Our findings help explain the persistent non-zero CDS-bond basis in euro area sovereign debt markets and its increase during the last sovereign crisis.</p>

Banks in jurisdictions which implemented the FSB's Principles and Standards of Sound Compensation in national legislation changed their compensation policies more than other banks. Compensation in those jurisdictions is less linked to short-term profits and more linked to risks, with CEOs at riskier banks receiving less, by way of variable compensation, than those at less-risky peers.

<p>A substantial body of existing research suggests that asset price volatility is harmful to market liquidity. This paper explores a contrarian view that, by creating opportunities for profit making, exchange rate volatility can be beneficial to trading activity. Utilising granular data from the Thai foreign exchange (FX) market from January 2010 to March 2016, we find that the volatility of the US dollar-Thai baht exchange rate has significant positive effects on trading volume in the spot market, except at very high levels of volatility. We also observe significant heterogeneity in such effects across different types of market participant. In particular, FX volatility has positive effects on the FX trading activity of foreign and interbank players, but it negatively affects that of local players. These results are robust when we control for potential confounding variables, such as information arrivals, that can generate a positive but non-causal co-movement between volatility and volume.</p>

<p>Is monetary policy less effective in boosting aggregate demand and output during periods of persistently low interest rates? This paper reviews the reasons why this might be the case and the corresponding empirical evidence. Transmission could be weaker for two main reasons: (i) headwinds, which would typically arise in the wake of balance sheet recessions, when interest rates are low; and (ii) inherent non-linearities, which would kick in when interest rates are persistently low and would dampen their impact on spending. Our review of the evidence suggests that headwinds during the recovery from balance-sheet recessions tend to reduce monetary policy effectiveness. At the same time, there is also evidence of inherent non-linearities. That said, disentangling the two types of effect is very hard, not least given the limited extant work on this issue. In addition, there appears to be an independent role for nominal rates in the transmission process, regardless of the level of real (inflation-adjusted) rates.</p>

This paper is the first to match high-frequency QE purchase data with high-frequency inter-dealer data. We find economically significant price impacts at high (minute-by-minute) and low (daily) frequencies, highlighting the relevance of scarcity effects in bond markets. Asset purchase policies are not without side effects, though, as the induced scarcity has an adverse impact on liquidity conditions as measured by bid-ask spreads and inter-dealer order book depth. We further show that the price impact varies greatly with market conditions: it is considerably higher during episodes of illiquidity and when yields are higher.</p>

To address this question, we match firm-level balance sheet data with a large dataset of firm-level bonds for about 1,000 firms from 36 emerging market economies over the period 1998-2014. We augment a standard firm-level investment model to control for (country-specific) macroeconomic variables, and interact the effect of an exchange rate depreciation with several dimensions of bond composition, namely: 1) currency of issuance; 2) maturity structure of bonds; and 3) market of issuance. We find that, conditional on the amount of debt issued in foreign currency, an exchange rate depreciation can have a contractionary impact on a firm's investment spending.

<p>We document that observed international input-output linkages contribute substantially to synchronizing producer price inflation (PPI) across countries. Using a multi-country, industry-level dataset that combines information on PPI and exchange rates with international and domestic input-output linkages, we recover the underlying cost shocks that are propagated internationally via the global input-output network, thus generating the observed dynamics of PPI. We then compare the extent to which common global factors account for the variation in actual PPI and in the underlying cost shocks. Our main finding is that across a range of econometric tests, input-output linkages account for half of the global component of PPI inflation. We report three additional findings: (i) the results are similar when allowing for imperfect cost pass-through and demand complementarities; (ii) PPI synchronization across countries is driven primarily by common sectoral shocks and input-output linkages amplify co-movement primarily by propagating sectoral shocks; and (iii) the observed pattern of international input use preserves fat-tailed idiosyncratic shocks and thus leads to a fat-tailed distribution of inflation rates, i.e., periods of disinflation and high inflation.</p>

<p>Using a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) identified with a mix of sign and zero restrictions, we show that a restrictive bank loan supply shock has a strong and persistent negative impact on real GDP and the GDP deflator. This result comes about even though flows of other sources of financing, such as equity and debt securities, expand strongly and act as a "spare tire" for the reduction in bank loans. We show that this result can be rationalized by a recently revived view of banking, which holds that banks increase the nominal purchasing power of the economy when they create additional deposits in the act of lending. Consequently, our findings indicate that a substitution of bank loans by other sources of financing might have negative macroeconomic repercussions.</p>

In particular, we use logit and duration models of competing risks on a novel dataset of announced investment projects in Peru from different economic sectors. The empirical framework for the timing of investment is motivated by real option models for projects that take time to build, with commodity prices used as a proxy of expected future income and their volatility as a proxy for uncertainty.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that both a reduction in commodity prices and an increase in volatility increase the probability to delay investment in the mining sector, with an amplification effect when both simultaneously occur. In other sectors, delays in implementation occur more often in periods of high volatility. Probability regressions under a competing risk framework suggest that higher commodity prices lead to a higher probability of completion in all sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>Commodity prices are an important driver of fiscal policy and the business cycle in many developing and emerging market economies. We analyze a dynamic stochastic small-open-economy model of sovereign default, featuring endogenous fiscal policy and stochastic commodity revenues. The model accounts for a positive correlation of commodity revenues with government expenditures and a negative correlation with tax rates. We quantitatively document the extent to which the utilization of different financial hedging instruments by the government contributes to lowering the volatility of different macroeconomic variables and their correlation with commodity revenues. An event analysis illustrates how financial hedging instruments moderate fiscal adjustment in response to significant falls in the price of commodities. We evaluate the conditional and unconditional welfare gains for the representative household, generated by financial derivatives and commodity-indexed bonds.</p>

<p>The recent oil price fall has created concern among policy makers regarding the consequences of terms of trade shocks for resource-rich countries. This concern is not a minor one - the world's commodity exporters combined are responsible for 15-20% of global value added. We develop and estimate a two-country New Keynesian model in order to quantify the importance of oil price shocks for Norway - a large, prototype petroleum exporter. Domestic supply chains link mainland (nonoil) Norway to the off-shore oil industry, while fiscal authorities accumulate income in a sovereign wealth fund. Oil prices and the international business cycle are jointly determined abroad. These features allow us to disentangle the structural sources of oil price fluctuations, and how they affect mainland Norway. The estimated model provides three key results. First, oil price movements represent an important source of macroeconomic volatility in mainland Norway. Second, while no two shocks cause the same dynamics, conventional trade channels make an economically less significant difference for the transmission of global shocks to the oil exporter than to oil importers. Third, the domestic oil industry's supply chain is an important transmission mechanism for oil price movements, while the prevailing fiscal regime provides substantial protection against external shocks.</p>

<p>Since 2008, oil and equity returns have moved together much more than they did previously. In addition, we show that both oil and equity returns have become more responsive to macroeconomic news. Before 2008, there is little evidence that oil returns were responsive to macroeconomic news. We argue that these results are consistent with a new-Keynesian model that includes oil and incorporates the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

<p><em>Paper produced as part of the BIS Consultative Council for the Americas Research Network project "<a href="/am_office/rsn/tccmafsi.htm">The commodity cycle: macroeconomic and financial stability implications</a>"</em></p>
<p>Policy prescriptions for managing natural resource windfalls are based on the permanent income hypothesis: none of the windfall is invested at home and saving in an intergenerational SWF is dictated by smoothing consumption across different generations. Furthermore, with Dutch disease effects the optimal response is to intertemporally smooth the real exchange rate, smooth public and private consumption, and limit sharp fluctuations in the intersectoral allocation of production factors. We show that these prescriptions need to be modified for the following reasons. First, to cope with volatile commodity prices precautionary buffers should be put in a stabilisation fund. Second, with imperfect access to capital markets the windfall must be used to curb capital scarcity, invest domestically and bring consumption forward. Third, with real wage rigidity consumption must also be brought forward to mitigate transient unemployment. Fourth, the real exchange rate has to temporarily appreciate to signal the need to invest in the domestic economy to gradually improve the ability to absorb the extra spending from the windfall. Fifth, with finite lives the timing of handing back the windfall to the private sector matters and consumption and the real exchange rate will be volatile. Finally, with nominal wage rigidity we show that a Taylor rule is a better short-run response to a crash in commodity prices than a nominal exchange rate peg.</p>

<p>In an interconnected world, national economic policies regularly lead to large international spillover effects, which frequently trigger calls for international policy cooperation. However, the premise of successful cooperation is that there is a Pareto inefficiency, i.e. if there is scope to make some nations better off without hurting others. This paper presents a first welfare theorem for open economies that defines an efficient benchmark and spells out the conditions that need to be violated to generate inefficiency and scope for cooperation. These are: (i) policymakers act competitively in the international market, (ii) policymakers have sufficient external policy instruments and (iii) international markets are free of imperfections. Our theorem holds even if each economy suffers from a wide range of domestic market imperfections and targeting problems. We provide examples of current account intervention, monetary policy, fiscal policy, macroprudential policy/capital controls, and exchange rate management and show that the resulting spillovers are Pareto efficient, but only if the three conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, we develop general guidelines for how policy cooperation can improve welfare when the conditions are violated.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the foreign funding mix of globally active banks. Using BIS international banking statistics for a panel of 12 advanced economies, we detect a structural break in international bank funding at the onset of the global financial crisis. In their post-break business model, banks rely less on cross-border liabilities and, instead, tap funds from outside their jurisdictions by making more active use of their subsidiaries and branches, as well as inter-office accounts within the same banking group.</p>

<p>Most of the international macro models, in contrast to the data, imply a very high level of risk sharing across countries and very low real exchange rate (RER) volatility relative to output. In this paper we show that a standard two-country two-good model augmented with conintegrated TFP processes comes closer to matching the data. We first show that the tradable and non-tradable total factor productivity (TFP) processes of the US and Europe have unit roots and can be modelled by a vector error correction model (VECM). Then, we develop a standard two-country and two-good (tradable and non-tradable) DSGE model and study the quantitative implications. Cointegrated TFP shocks, or trend shocks, generate significant income effects and amplify the mechanisms that produce high RER volatility. Moreover, trend shocks can break the tight link between relative consumption and RER for low and high values of trade elasticity parameters.</p>

<p>This paper analyses the effectiveness of monetary policy on bank lending in a low interest rate environment. Based on a sample of 108 large international banks, our empirical analysis suggests that reductions in short-term interest rates are less effective in stimulating bank lending growth when rates reach a very low level. This result holds after controlling for business and financial cycle conditions and different bank-specific characteristics such as liquidity, capitalisation, funding costs, bank risk and income diversification. We find that the impact of low rates on the profitability of banks' traditional intermediation activity helps explain the subdued evolution of lending in the period 2010-14.</p>

<p>This paper examines the effects of taxation on the liability structure of banks. We derive testable predictions from a dynamic model of optimal bank liability structure that incorporates bank runs, regulatory closure and endogenous default. Using the supervisory data provided by the Bank of Italy, we empirically test these predictions by exploiting exogenous variations of the Italian tax rates on productive activities (IRAP) across regions and over time (especially since the global financial crisis). We show that banks endogenously respond to a reduction in tax rates by reducing non-deposit liabilities more than deposits in addition to lowering leverage. The response on the asset side depends on the financial strength of the bank: well-capitalized banks respond to a reduction in tax rates by increasing their assets, but poorly-capitalized banks respond by cleaning up their balance sheet.</p>

<p>The paper analyses and compares the domestic and cross-border effects of US and euro area unconventional monetary policy measures on 24 major advanced and emerging economies, based on an estimated global vector error-correction model (GVECM). Unconventional monetary policies are measured using shadow interest rates developed by Lombardi and Zhu (2014). Monetary policy shocks are identified using sign restrictions. The GVECM impulse responses suggest that US unconventional monetary policy generally has stronger domestic and cross-border impacts than euro area non-standard measures. Its spillovers to other economies are estimated to be more sizeable and persistent, especially in terms of output growth and inflation. There is evidence of diverse responses in the emerging economies in terms of exchange rate pressures, credit growth as well as monetary policy. In addition, the strength of cross-border transmission channels to the emerging economies appears to differ for US and euro area policies.</p>

<p>We study the response of a three-sector commodity-exporter small open economy to a commodity price boom. When the economy has access to international borrowing and lending, a <em>temporary</em> commodity price boom brings about the standard wealth effect that stimulates demand and has <em>long-run</em> implications on the sectoral allocation of labor. If dynamic productivity gains are concentrated in the traded goods sector, the commodity boom crowds out the traded sector and delays convergence to the world technology frontier. Financial openness by stimulating current demand, amplifies the crowding out effect and may even lead to a growth trap, in which no resources are allocated to the traded sector. From a normative point of view, our analysis suggests that capital account management policies could be welfare improving in those circumstances.</p>

If asset managers use their cash holding as a buffer to meet redemptions, they can mitigate fire sales of the underlying asset. If they hoard cash in anticipation of redemptions, they will amplify fire sales. We present a global game model of investor runs and identify conditions under which asset managers hoard cash.

<p>Household debt levels relative to GDP have risen rapidly in many countries over the past decade. We investigate the macroeconomic impact of such increases by employing a novel estimation technique proposed by Chudik et al (2016), which tackles the problem of endogeneity present in traditional regressions. Using data on 54 economies over 1990-2015, we show that household debt boosts consumption and GDP growth in the short run, mostly within one year. By contrast, a 1 percentage point increase in the household debt-to-GDP ratio tends to lower growth in the long run by 0.1 percentage point. Our results suggest that the negative long-run effects on consumption tend to intensify as the household debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 60%. For GDP growth, that intensification seems to occur when the ratio exceeds 80%. Finally, we find that the degree of legal protection of creditors is able to account for the cross-country variation in the long-run impact.</p>

<p>In this paper, we use time-varying VAR models to study the effects of option-implied measures of equity and bond market volatilities on the government bond term premium and key macroeconomic variables. We show that the high correlation between the two volatilities requires that shocks to these variables be jointly identified. We find that a positive shock to the VIX reduces the term premium. We interpret this effect as the result of investors shifting their portfolios away from riskier assets. The positive shock to the VIX also has contractionary and disinflationary effects. By contrast, a positive shock to the MOVE, which reflects heightened uncertainty about future changes in interest rates, raises the term premium. Similar to a VIX shock, an increase in bond market volatility also has a contractionary effect, although the negative effects on output and inflation are smaller. Both VIX and MOVE shocks resemble negative demand shocks, albeit of different intensity, to which the central bank responds by easing monetary policy. Depending on the type of volatility impacting the economy, a contraction in output can be associated with either a flattening or steepening of the yield curve.</p>

<p>This paper presents new evidence on wage and price setting based on a survey of more than 300 Uruguayan firms in 2013. Most of the firms set prices considering costs and adding a profit margin; therefore, they have some degree of market power. The evidence indicates that price increases appear quite flexible in Uruguay (prices are downward rigid). Most of the firms adjust their prices without following a regular frequency which suggests that price changes in Uruguay are state-dependent, although wage changes are concentrated in January and July. Interestingly, the cost of credit is seen by companies as an irrelevant factor in explaining price increases. We also find that cost reduction is the principal strategy to a negative demand shock. Finally, the adjustment of prices to changes in wages is relatively fast.</p>

<p>Empirical and institutional evidence finds considerable time variation in the degree of wage indexation to past inflation, a finding that is at odds with the assumption of constant indexation parameters in most New-Keynesian DSGE models. We build a DSGE model with endogenous wage indexation in which utility maximizing workers select a wage indexation rule in response to aggregate shocks and monetary policy. We show that workers index wages to past inflation when output fluctuations are driven by technology and permanent inflation-target shocks, whereas they index to trend inflation when aggregate demand shocks dominate output fluctuations. The model's equilibrium wage setting can explain the time variation in wage indexation found in post-WWII U.S. data.</p>

<p>Research on interbank networks and systemic importance is starting to recognise that the web of exposures linking banks' balance sheets is more complex than the single-layer-of-exposure approach suggests. We use data on exposures between large European banks, broken down by both maturity and instrument type, to characterise the main features of the multiplex (or multi-layered) structure of the network of large European banks. Banks that are well connected or important in one network, tend to also be well connected in other networks (i.e. the network features positively correlated multiplexity). The different layers exhibit a high degree of similarity, stemming both from standard similarity analyses as well as a core-periphery analyses at the layer level. We propose measures of systemic importance that fit the case in which banks are connected through an arbitrary number of layers (be it by instrument, maturity or a combination of both). Such measures allow for a decomposition of the global systemic importance index for any bank into the contributions of each of the sub-networks, providing a potentially useful tool for banking regulators and supervisors in identifying tailored policy responses. We use the dataset of exposures between large European banks to illustrate that both the methodology and the specific level of network aggregation may matter both in the determination of <em>interconnectedness</em> and in the policy making process.</p>

<p>Greater international economic interconnectedness over recent decades has been changing inflation dynamics. This paper presents evidence that the expansion of global value chains (GVCs), ie cross-border trade in intermediate goods and services, is an important channel through which global economic slack influences domestic inflation. In particular, we document the extent to which the growth in GVCs explains the established empirical correlation between global economic slack and national inflation rates, both across countries and over time. Accounting for the role of GVCs, we also find that the conventional trade-based measures of openness used in previous studies are poor proxies for this transmission channel. The results support the hypothesis that as GVCs expand, direct and indirect competition among economies increases, making domestic inflation more sensitive to the global output gap. This can affect the trade-offs that central banks face when managing inflation.</p>

<p><strong>Asymmetric information and the securitization of SME loans</strong> (2:00)</p>
<p>Did banks' practice of selling loans on to other investors deserve the bad reputation it gained during the financial crisis?</p>

<p>Using credit register data for loans to Italian firms we test for the presence of asymmetric information in the securitization market by looking at the correlation between the securitization (risk-transfer) and the default (accident) probability. We can disentangle the adverse selection from the moral hazard component for the many firms with multiple bank relationships. We find that adverse selection is widespread but that moral hazard is confined to weak relationships, indicating that a strong relationship is a credible enough commitment to monitor after securitization. Importantly, the selection of which loans to securitize based on observables is such that it largely offsets the (negative) effects of asymmetric information, rendering the overall unconditional quality of securitized loans significantly better than that of non-securitized ones. Thus, despite the presence of asymmetric information, our results do not accord with the view that credit-risk transfer leads to lax credit standards.</p>

We use newly available unique data on the bilateral crossborder lending flows of 27 BIS-reporting lending banking systems to over 50 borrowing countries, broken down by currency denomination (USD, EUR and JPY). We have three main findings. First, monetary shocks in a currency significantly affect cross-border lending flows in that currency, even when neither the lending banking system nor the borrowing country uses that currency as their own. Second, this transmission works mainly through lending to non-banks. Third, this currency dimension of the bank lending channel works similarly across the three currencies suggesting that the cross-border bank lending channel of liquidity shock transmission may not be unique to lending in USD.</p>

<p>This paper presents a general equilibrium model with a dynamic banking sector to characterize optimal size-dependent bank capital regulation (CR). Bank leverage choices are subject to the risk-return trade-off: high leverage increases expected return on capital, but also increases return variance and bank failure risk. Financial frictions imply that bank leverage choices are socially inefficient, providing scope for a welfare-enhancing CR that imposes a cap on bank leverage. The optimal CR is tighter relative to the pre-crisis benchmark. Optimal CR is also bank specific, and tighter for large banks than for small banks. This is for three reasons. First, allowing small banks to take more leverage enables them to potentially grow faster, leading to a growth effect. Second, although more leverage by small banks results in a higher exit rate, these exits are by the less efficient banks, leading to a cleansing effect. Third, failures are more costly among large banks, because these are more efficient in equilibrium and intermediate more capital. Therefore, tighter regulation for large banks renders them less prone to failure, leading to a stabilization effect. In terms of industry dynamics, tighter CR results in a smaller bank exit rate and a larger equilibrium mass of better capitalized banks, even though physical capital stock and wages are lower. The calibrated model rationalizes various steady state moments of the US banking industry, and provides general support for the Basel III GSIB framework.</p>

<p>As a result of legal restrictions on branch banking, an extensive interbank system developed in the United States during the 19th century to facilitate interregional payments and flows of liquidity and credit. Vast sums moved through the interbank system to meet seasonal and other demands, but the system also transmitted shocks during banking panics. The Federal Reserve was established in 1914 to reduce reliance on the interbank market and correct other defects that caused banking system instability. Drawing on recent theoretical work on interbank networks, we examine how the Fed's establishment affected the system's resilience to solvency and liquidity shocks and whether these shocks might have been contagious. We find that the interbank system became more resilient to solvency shocks, but less resilient to liquidity shocks, as banks sharply reduced their liquidity after the Fed's founding. The industry's response illustrates how the introduction of a lender of last resort can alter private behavior in a way that increases the likelihood that the lender may be needed.</p>

<p>We present a network model of the interbank market in which optimizing risk averse banks lend to each other and invest in non-liquid assets. Market clearing takes place through a tâtonnement process which yields the equilibrium price, while traded quantities are determined by means of an assortative matching process. Contagion occurs through liquidity hoarding, interbank interlinkages and fire sale externalities. The resulting network configuration exhibits a core-periphery structure, disassortative behavior and low density. Within this framework we analyse the effects of a stylized set of prudential policies on the stability/efficiency trade-off. Liquidity requirements unequivocally decrease systemic risk, but at the cost of lower efficiency (measured by aggregate investment in non-liquid assets). Equity requirements also tend to reduce risk (hence increase stability), though without reducing significantly overall investment. On this basis, our results provide general support for the Basel III approach based on complementary regulatory metrics.</p>

<p>We study the transmission mechanisms of liquidity and capital regulations as well as their effects on the economy and welfare. We propose a macro-economic model in which a regulator faces the following trade-off. On the one hand, banking regulations may reduce the aggregate supply of credit. On the other hand, they promote the allocation of credit to its best uses. Accordingly, in a regulated economy there is less, but more productive lending. Based on a version of the model calibrated on US data, we find that both liquidity and capital requirements are needed, and must be set relatively high. They also mutually reinforce each other, except when liquid assets are scarce. Our analysis thus provides broad support for Basel III's "multiple metrics" framework.</p>

<p>This paper analyses how non-performing loans (NPLs) of Indian banks behave through the cycle. We find that a one-percentage point increase in loan growth is associated with an increase in NPLs over total advances (NPL ratio) of 4.3 per cent in the long run with the response being higher during expansionary phases. Furthermore, NPL ratios of banks are found to be sensitive to the interest rate environment and the overall growth of the economy. Notwithstanding differences in management and governance structures, there is a procyclical risk-taking response to credit growth in the case of both public and private banks with private banks being more reactive to changes in interest rate and business cycle conditions.</p>

<p>Should a monetary authority lean against the build-up of financial imbalances? We study this policy question in an environment in which there are recurring cycles of financial imbalances that develop over time and eventually collapse in a costly manner. The optimal policy reflects the trade-off between the short-run macroeconomic costs of leaning against the wind and the longer-run benefits of stabilising the financial cycle. We model the financial cycle as a nonlinear Markov regime-switching process, calibrate the model to US data and characterise the optimal monetary policy. Leaning systematically over the whole financial cycle is found to outperform policies of "benign neglect" and "late-in-the-cycle" discretionary interventions. This conclusion is robust to a wide range of alternative assumptions and supports an orientation shift in monetary policy frameworks away from narrow price stability to a joint consideration of price and financial stability.</p>

<p>Do macroprudential regulations on residential lending influence commercial lending behavior too? To answer this question, we identify the compositional changes in banks' supply of credit using the variation in their holdings of residential mortgages on which extra capital requirements were uniformly imposed by the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) introduced in Switzerland in 2012. We find that the CCB's introduction led to higher growth in commercial lending, in particular to small firms, although this was unrelated to conditions in regional housing markets. The interest rates and fees charged to these firms concurrently increased. We rationalize these findings in a model featuring both private and firm-specific collateral. The corresponding imperfect substitutability between private and commercial credit for the entrepreneur's relationship bank is then shown to give rise to the compositional patterns we empirically document.</p>

<p>We document the triangular relationship formed by the strength of the US dollar, cross-border bank lending in dollars and deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). A stronger dollar goes hand-in-hand with bigger deviations from CIP and contractions of cross-border bank lending in dollars. Differential sensitivity of CIP deviations to the strength of the dollar can explain cross-sectional variations in CIP arbitrage profits. We argue that underpinning the triangle is the role of the dollar as proxy for the shadow price of bank leverage.</p>

<p>As the Basel III package nears completion, the emphasis is shifting to monitoring its implementation and assessing the impact of the reforms. This paper presents a simple conceptual framework to assess the macroeconomic impact of the core Basel III reforms, including the leverage ratio surcharge that is being considered for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). We use historical data for a large sample of major banks to generate a conservative approximation of the additional amount of capital that banks would need to raise to meet the new regulatory requirements, taking the potential impact of current efforts to enhance G-SIBs' total loss-absorbing capacity into account. To provide a high-level proxy for the effect of changes in capital allocation and bank business models on the estimated net benefits of regulatory reform, we simulate the effect of banks converging towards the "critical" average risk weights (or "density ratios") implied by the combined risk-weighted and leverage ratio-based capital requirements. While keeping in mind that quantifying the regulatory impact remains subject to caveats, the results suggest that Basel III can be expected to generate sizeable macroeconomic net benefits even after the implied changes to bank business models have been taken into account.</p>

<p>The failure of covered interest parity (CIP), or, equivalently, the persistence of the cross currency basis, in tranquil markets has presented a puzzle. Focusing on the basis against the US dollar (USD), we show that the CIP deviations that are not due to transaction costs or bank credit risk can be explained by the demand to hedge USD forward. Fluctuations in FX hedging demand matter because committing the balance sheet to arbitrage is costly. With limits to arbitrage, CIP arbitrageurs charge a premium in the forward markets for taking the other side of FX hedgers' demand. We find that measures of FX hedging demand, combined with proxies for the risks associated with CIP arbitrage, improve the explanatory power of standard regressions.</p>

<p>We combine the BIS international banking statistics with the IBRN prudential instruments database in a global study analyzing the effect of prudential measures on international lending. Our bilateral setting, which features multiple home and destination countries, allows us to simultaneously estimate both the international transmission and the local effects of such measures. We find that changes in macroprudential policy via loan-to-value limits and local currency reserve requirements have a significant impact on international bank lending. Balance sheet characteristics play an important role in determining the strength of these effects, with better capitalized banking systems and those with more liquid assets and less core deposits reacting more. Overall, our results suggest that the tightening of these macroprudential measures can be associated with international spillovers.</p>

<p>The Bernanke-Blinder closed economy model suggests that macroprudential policies aimed at bank lending will affect the domestic long-term interest rate. In an open economy, domestic shocks to long-term rates are likely to influence capital flows and the exchange rate. Currency movements feed back into domestic credit through several channels, which will be influenced by balance sheet positions and not only by income flows. Macroprudential policies aimed at domestic credit and at foreign currency borrowing may be the best option open to small countries facing very low global interest rates and risky domestic credit expansion.</p>

<p>The Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09 and its aftermath have emphasised the need for a global approach when assessing financial stability risks. One difficulty is that the traditional apparatus, especially the System of National Accounts (SNA), relies on the criterion of residency to capture statistical information within countries' boundaries. This paper analyses how to collect meaningful data to assess consolidated risk exposures. In particular, it argues that data collected along the residency-based SNA concept can be usefully complemented by a nationality-based, global approach. This requires the establishment of a framework for assessing financial positions on a socalled "nationality-basis", that is, at a globally consolidated level.</p>

<p>The global financial crisis has highlighted the limitations of risk-sensitive bank capital ratios. To tackle this problem, the Basel III regulatory framework has introduced a minimum leverage ratio, defined as a banks Tier 1 capital over an exposure measure, which is independent of risk assessment. Using a medium sized DSGE model that features a banking sector, financial frictions and various economic agents with differing degrees of creditworthiness, we seek to answer three questions: 1) How does the leverage ratio behave over the cycle compared with the risk-weighted asset ratio? 2) What are the costs and the benefits of introducing a leverage ratio, in terms of the levels and volatilities of some key macro variables of interest? 3) What can we learn about the interaction of the two regulatory ratios in the long run? The main answers are the following: 1) The leverage ratio acts as a backstop to the risk-sensitive capital requirement: it is a tight constraint during a boom and a soft constraint in a bust; 2) the net benefits of introducing the leverage ratio could be substantial; 3) the steady state value of the regulatory minima for the two ratios strongly depends on the riskiness and the composition of bank lending portfolios. </p>

<p>How central banks can best communicate to the market is an increasingly important topic in the central banking literature. With ever greater frequency, central banks communicate to the market through the forecasts of prices and output with the purposes of reducing uncertainty; at the same time, central banks generally rely on a publicly stated medium-term inflation target to help anchor expectations. This paper aims to document how much the release of the forecasts of one major central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), has influenced private sector expectations of inflation, and whether the degree of influence depends to any degree on the adoption of an inflation target (IT). Consistent with earlier studies, we find the central bank's forecasts to be quite influential on private sector forecasts. In the case of next year forecasts, their impact continues into the IT regime. Thus, the difficulties of aiming at an inflation target from below do not necessarily diminish the influence of the central bank's inflation forecasts. </p>

<p>The Beveridge-Nelson (BN) trend-cycle decomposition based on autoregressive forecasting models of U.S. quarterly real GDP growth produces estimates of the output gap that are strongly at odds with widely-held beliefs about the amplitude, persistence, and even sign of transitory movements in economic activity. These antithetical attributes are related to the autoregressive coefficient estimates implying a very high signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the variance of trend shocks as a fraction of the overall quarterly forecast error variance. When we impose a lower signal-to-noise ratio, the resulting BN decomposition, which we label the "BN filter", produces a more intuitive estimate of the output gap that is large in amplitude, highly persistent, and typically positive in expansions and negative in recessions. Real-time estimates from the BN filter are also reliable in the sense that they are subject to smaller revisions and predict future output growth and inflation better than for other methods of trend-cycle decomposition that also impose a low signal-to-noise ratio, including deterministic detrending, the Hodrick-Prescott filter, and the bandpass filter.</p>

First, exchange rate pass-through in emerging economies decreased after the financial crisis, while exchange rate pass-through in advanced economies has remained relatively low and stable over time. Second, we show that the declining pass-through in emerging markets is related to declining inflation.

<p>Inflation co-moves across countries and several papers have shown that lags of this common inflation can help to forecast country inflation. This paper constructs forecasts of common (or 'global') inflation using survey forecasts of country inflation. These forecasts of global inflation have predictive power for global inflation at a medium horizon (12 months) but not at a longer horizon. Global inflation forecasts, and forecast errors, are correlated with survey forecasts and errors of oil and food prices, and global GDP growth, but not financial variables. For some countries, forecasts of global inflation improve the accuracy of forecasting regressions that include survey forecasts of country inflation. In-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasting exercises suggest that forecasts of global inflation generally contain more information for forecasting country inflation than do lags of global inflation. However, for most countries, lagged or forecast global inflation does not improve the accuracy of survey forecasts of country inflation. Whatever information global inflation may include about country inflation, for most countries it seems that survey forecasts of country inflation have historically already incorporated that information.</p>

<p>The 1960s and 1970s witnessed rapid growth in the markets for new money market instruments, such as negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) and Eurodollar deposits, as banks and investors sought ways around various regulations affecting funding markets. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of the deregulation and integration of the money markets. We find that the pricing and volume of negotiable CDs and Eurodollars issued were influenced by the availability of other short-term safe assets, especially Treasury bills. Banks appear to have issued these money market instruments as substitutes for other types of funding. The integration of money markets and ability of banks to raise funds using a greater variety of substitutable instruments has implications for monetary policy. We find that, when deregulation reduced money market segmentation, larger open market operations were required to produce a given change in the federal funds rate, but that the pass through of changes in the funds rate to other market rates was also greater.</p>

<p>Dividend payouts affect the relative value of claims within a firm. When firms have contingent claims on each other, as in the banking sector, dividend payouts can shift the relative value of stakeholders' claims <em>across</em> firms. Through this channel, one bank's capital policy affects the equity value and risk of default of other banks. In a model where such externalities are strong, bank capital takes on the attribute of a public good, where the private equilibrium features excessive dividends and inefficient recapitalization relative to the efficient policy that maximizes banking sector equity. We compare the implications of the model with observed bank behavior during the crisis of 2007-09.</p>

<p>An asset manager's rapid liquidation in the weeks around the end of September 2014 of a very large position in eurodollar futures, a huge derivatives market that allows traders to position on the future path of dollar money rates, raises two questions. What is the profile of asset managers in this key market? And how has the Federal Reserve's unconventional monetary policy, including forward guidance about policy rates, affected this market? Asset managers generally hold the largest eurodollar positions among buy-side traders but play a lesser role in day-to-day trading. Second, the Fed's unconventional policy saw the average maturity of eurodollar contracts traded between 2008 and 2014 double and it has remained at an elevated maturity since then. Moreover, from 2012 into 2015 eurodollar turnover responded more strongly to Federal Reserve announcements than to macroeconomic news, a finding analogous to that of Filardo and Hofmann (2014) for yields. In 2015 asset managers took a large short position in eurodollar futures; this unprecedented position would profit if the Federal Reserve's own projections of policy rates ("dots") were realised. Judging from eurodollar futures, asset managers now play an important role in facilitating or hindering the transmission of monetary policy to market rates.</p>

<p>The majority of financial trades take place in open and highly regulated markets. As an alternative venue, large asset managers sometimes offset the trades of affiliated funds in an internal market, without relying on external facilities or supervision. In this paper, we employ institutional trade-level data to examine such cross-trades. We find that cross-trades used to display a spread of 46 basis points with respect to open market trades before more restrictive regulation was adopted. The introduction of tighter supervision decreased this spread by 59 basis points, bringing the execution price of cross-trades below that of open market trades. We additionally find that cross-trades presented larger deviations from benchmark prices when the exchanged stocks were illiquid and highly volatile, during high financial uncertainty times, and when the asset manager had weak governance, large internal markets, and a strong incentive for reallocating performance. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that cross-trades are more likely than open-market trades to be executed exactly at the highest or lowest price of the day, consistent with the ex post setting of the price. Our results are consistent with theoretical models of internal capital markets in which the headquarters actively favors its "stars" at the expense of the least valuable units.</p>

<p>This paper studies how global banks transmit liquidity shocks via their internal capital markets. The unexpected access of German banks' affiliates located in the United States (US) to the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility (TAF) serves as our liquidity shock. Using microdata on all affiliates abroad, we test whether affiliates located <em>outside</em> the US adjusted their balance sheets during periods, when the US-located affiliate of the same parent received TAF loans. Our analysis has three main findings. First, during periods of active TAF borrowing, foreign affiliates of parent banks with high US dollar funding needs reduced their foreign assets by less. We identify those parents based on their pre-crisis exposure to the US asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market. Second, foreign affiliates in financial centers also shrank their assets less. Third, there is no evidence that the ABCP exposure per se is driving the reduction of activity outside the US. In sum, our results show that the TAF program spilled over into foreign markets, while highlighting the importance of actively managed internal capital markets and the increased centralization of global banks' liquidity management at the domestic parent during and after the financial crisis.</p>

<p>We investigate the importance of the housing-based collateral lending channel on firm borrowing, investment and employment. We focus on small firms in France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. To identify a credit supply effect, as opposed to a home-equity driven demand effect, we compare activity in similar firms that differ by the degree of financial opacity, and therefore the degree of their reliance on collateral to overcome borrowing constraints. We find that changing house prices have a more pronounced effect on borrowing, investment and employment in financially more opaque firms. This relationship is particularly strong in southern Europe (Italy and Spain), where financial frictions are larger and the use of collateral more important.</p>

<p>International linkages between interest rates in different currencies are strong, and ultra-low rates have become a global phenomenon. This paper compares how interest rates in advanced economies and in emerging economies are conditioned by two global benchmarks - the Federal funds rate at the short end and the "world" real interest rate at the long end. Real equilibrium policy rates (the natural rate) have fallen in many countries, and short-term rates worldwide have been further depressed by many years of the US policy rate close to zero. Nevertheless, changes in the Federal funds rate have less effect on longer-term rates, and thus on financing conditions, than is often supposed. The decline in the world long-term rate since 2008 has been driven almost entirely by a fall in the world term premium (negative in nominal terms since mid-2014). The world short-term rate expected over the long run has fallen only modestly over the past seven years or so, and is now just over 2% (compared with around 4% pre-Lehman).</p>

<p>We examine the role of the CDS and bond markets during and before the recent euro area sovereign debt crisis as transmission channels for credit risk contagion between sovereign entities. We analyse an intraday dataset for GIIPS countries as well as Germany, France and central European countries. Our findings suggest that, prior to the crisis, the CDS and bond markets were similarly important in the transmission of sovereign risk contagion, but that the importance of the bond market waned during the crisis. We find flight-to-safety effects during the crisis in the German bond market that are not present in the pre-crisis sample. Our estimated sovereign risk contagion was greater during the crisis, with an average timeline of one to two hours in GIIPS countries. By using an exogenous macroeconomic news shock, we can show that, during the crisis period, increased credit risk was not related to economic fundamentals. Further, we find that central European countries were not affected by sovereign credit risk contagion, independent of their debt level and currency.</p>

<p>Piketty (2014) documents how the share of aggregate income going to capital in the United States has risen in the post-war era. Rognlie (2015) has since shown that this is largely due to the housing sector. This paper explores the determinants of the secular rise in the share of housing capital income (or 'rental income') in the US economy. I first decompose the aggregate national accounts by geographic region and also by type of housing. I then exploit variation across US states in factors that could explain housing capital income, such as interest rates, housing prices and income growth.</p>
<p>The analysis shows that the long-run increase in the aggregate share of housing capital income is mainly due to higher imputed rental income going to owner-occupiers. I also find evidence that the rise in the share of housing capital income over recent decades reflects a combination of: 1) lower real interest rates; 2) lower consumer price inflation; and 3) constraints on the supply of new housing in some large US cities. In effect, the paper documents that the fall in nominal interest rates over the 1980s and 1990s raised the demand for housing and pushed up housing prices and rents (relative to non-housing prices) in supply-constrained areas. I estimate that the long-term decline in interest rates can explain more than half the increase in the share of nominal income spent on housing since the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Most quantitative easing programmes primarily involve central banks acquiring government liabilities in return for central bank reserves. In all cases this process is undertaken by purchasing these liabilities in the secondary market rather than directly from the government. Yet the only practical difference between secondary market purchases and bilateral central bank/Treasury operations is the transactions costs involved in market operations. This paper quantifies the significant cost of this round-trip transaction - government issuance of liabilities and then central bank purchase of those liabilities in the secondary market.</p>

<p>We explore the effectiveness and balance of benefits and costs of so-called "unconventional" monetary policy measures extensively implemented in the wake of the financial crisis: balance sheet policies (commonly termed "quantitative easing"), forward guidance and negative policy rates. Our objective is to provide the reader with a helpful entry point to the burgeoning empirical literature and with a specific perspective on the complex issues involved. We reach three main conclusions: there is ample evidence that, to varying degrees, these measures have succeeded in influencing financial conditions even though their ultimate impact on output and inflation is harder to pin down; the balance of the benefits and costs is likely to deteriorate over time; and the measures are generally best regarded as exceptional, for use in very specific circumstances. Whether this will turn out to be the case, however, is doubtful at best and depends on more fundamental features of monetary policy frameworks. In the paper, we also provide a critique of prevailing analyses of "helicopter money" and explore in more depth the role of negative nominal interest rates in our fundamentally monetary economies, highlighting some risks.</p>

<p>Do the prevailing unusually and persistently low real interest rates reflect a decline in the natural rate of interest as commonly thought? We argue that this is only part of the story. The critical role of financial factors in influencing medium-term economic fluctuations must also be taken into account. Doing so for the United States yields estimates of the natural rate that are higher and, at least since 2000, decline by less. As a result, policy rates have been persistently and systematically below this measure. Moreover, we find that monetary policy, through the financial cycle, has a long-lasting impact on output and, by implication, on real interest rates. Therefore, a narrative that attributes the decline in real rates primarily to an exogenous fall in the natural rate is incomplete. The influence of monetary and financial factors should not be ignored. Exploiting these results, an illustrative counterfactual experiment suggests that a monetary policy rule that takes financial developments systematically into account during both good and bad times could help dampen the financial cycle, leading to higher output even in the long run.</p>

<p>We provide a measure of the output gap that filters out the impact of the commodity and net capital inflows booms for Latin American countries. These two factors temporarily boost output and so are likely to push up estimates of potential growth in the region to unrealistic levels, thereby resulting in an underestimation of the output gaps during the upswing of the commodity cycle. We also shed light on the interaction between the two components. The results show that commodity prices has been the dominant factor explaining deviation of activity from sustainable levels.

<p>This paper studies the evolution of the equilibrium real interest rate (ie natural or neutral interest rate) in Asia-Pacific. I take an empirical approach to estimate the rate, simple estimates suggest that except for China, and Thailand since 2005, the natural interest rate may have declined substantially in Asian-Pacific economies since the early or mid-1990s, by over 4 percentage points on average. In many economies the rate has turned negative. The tendency has become more accentuated in the 2000s, especially since the onset of the global financial crisis. Yet simple natural interest rate estimates are unreliable, which vary significantly over time and across the economies.</p>
<p>I use frequency-domain techniques to examine the relationship between the long-run component of real interest rate and those of population characteristics, globalisation, and a range of macroeconomic and financial variables (eg credit and asset prices). I estimate spectral and cospectral densities, coherency and the frequency-specific coefficients of correlation and regression proposed by Zhu (2005). the association seems to be broad and strong between the natural interest rate and the low-frequency trend components of demographic and global factors in Asia- Pacific, but weak between the natural interest rate and trends in asset prices, creditto GDP ratio and trend growth in many economies in the region. In most cases, the natural interest rate seems to be correlated with broad measures of long-term financial sector development, and trends in saving rate and investment ratio.</p>

<p>This paper uses a cross-country database covering 46 economies over the post-war period to revisit two key monetary facts: (i) the long-run link between money growth and inflation and (ii) the link between credit growth and financial crises. The analysis reveals that the former has weakened over time, while the latter has become stronger. Moreover, the money-inflation nexus has been stronger in emerging market economies than in advanced economies, while it is the other way round for the link between credit growth and financial crises. These results suggest that there is an inverse relationship between the two monetary facts. The money-inflation link is weaker in regimes characterised by low inflation and highly liberalised financial systems, while the reverse holds true for the credit-crisis nexus.</p>

<p>Active wholesale financial markets help reallocate deposits across heterogeneous banks. Because of incentive problems, these flows are constrained and collateral is needed. Both the volume, the value, and the <em>composition</em> of collateral matter. We make a distinction between "outside collateral" and "inside collateral". The use of inside assets, such as loans, creates a "collateral pyramid", in that cash flows from one loan can be pledged to secure another. Through collateral pyramids the financial sector creates safe assets, but at the cost of exposing the economy to systemic panics. Outside collateral, such as treasuries, serves as foundation of, and stabilises, the pyramid. There is a threshold for the volume of treasuries, below which investors panic, the pyramid collapses, and there is not enough safe assets to support wholesale market activity; a situation that we call "collateral trap".</p>

<p>Who provides liquidity in modern, electronic limit order book, markets? While agency trading can be constrained by conflicts of interest and information asymmetry between customers and traders, prop traders are likely to be less constrained and thus better positioned to carry inventory risk. Moreover, while slow traders' limit orders may be exposed to severe adverse selection, fast trading technology can improve traders' ability to monitor the market and avoid being picked off. To shed light on these points, we rely on unique data from Euronext and the AMF, the French financial markets regulator, enabling us to observe the connectivity of traders to the market, and whether they are proprietary traders. We find that proprietary traders, be they fast or slow, provide liquidity with contrarian marketable orders, thus helping the market absorb shocks, even during a crisis, and they earn profits while doing so. Moreover, fast traders provide liquidity by leaving limit orders in the book. Yet, only prop traders can do so without making losses. This suggests that technology is not enough to overcome adverse selection; monitoring incentives are also needed.</p>

This catch-up is driven by a rise in global factor betas, not a rise in factor volatilities, suggesting that the effect is likely to be permanent. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence for a global factor model catch-up in terms of pricing errors (alpha) or a convergence in country-specific factor premia. These findings suggest that global financial markets have progressed surprisingly little towards fully integrated pricing, different from what should be expected under financial market integration.

While we find higher house prices to increase mortgage demand, banks respond if anything with fewer offers and higher rates, especially later in the boom and for highly leveraged households.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the run on Continental Illinois in 1984. We find that the run slowed but did not stop following an extraordinary government intervention, which included the guarantee of all liabilities of the bank and a commitment to provide ongoing liquidity support. Continental's outflows were driven by a broad set of US and foreign financial institutions. These were large, sophisticated creditors with holdings far in excess of the insurance limit. During the initial run, creditors with relatively liquid balance sheets nevertheless withdrew more than other creditors, likely reflecting low tolerance to hold illiquid assets. In addition, smaller and moredistant creditors were more likely to withdraw. In the second and more drawn out phase of the run, institutions with relative large exposures to Continental were more likely to withdraw, reflecting a general unwillingness to have an outsized exposure to a troubled institution even in the absence of credit risk. Finally, we show that the concentration of holdings of Continental's liabilities was a key dynamic in the run and was importantly linked to Continental's systemic importance.</p>

<p>We investigate how the short-term effects of fiscal consolidation on output and employment vary with the state of the business cycle, monetary policy, public debt, the current account, and private credit. By examining the response of a large number of variables, we are also able to shed light on the transmission channels of fiscal policy. Our main finding is that short-term output multipliers are below unity, even in states in which multipliers are expected to be larger (eg when the output gap is negative or monetary policy tight). Key offsetting factors that reduce the size of multipliers and explain differences across states are the extent to which the external sector improves and monetary policy eases.</p>

<p>A new dimension to currency mismatches has been created by policies that have increased global liquidity. Lower policy rates and a huge expansion in central bank balance sheets - purchases of domestic bonds in the advanced economies and of foreign assets in the emerging market economies (EMEs) - have served to ease financing conditions facing EME companies. This has allowed these companies to increase their gearing, notably by greater foreign currency borrowing. Aggregate foreign currency mismatches of the non-government sector in the EMEs have therefore risen sharply since 2010. Microeconomic data show that it was not only companies providing tradable goods and services but also those producing non-tradable goods which have increased their foreign currency borrowing. The across-the-board decline in EME companies' profitability since mid-2014 has brought to light significant vulnerabilities that may aggravate market volatility. Weak corporate profitability is also likely to constrain business fixed investment, and therefore growth, in the near term. But the strong external asset positions of most emerging market economies will help the authorities cope with these challenges.</p>

<p>We study the determinants of loan loss provisions and delinquency ratios based on the balance sheets of 554 banks from emerging market economies (EMEs). We find that provisions in EME banks respond mostly to aggregate variables, and very little to idiosyncratic factors. In particular, the bank-specific credit growth rates - usually thought of as a measure of individual risk-taking - do not explain the level of loan loss provisions. There is some evidence that earnings and the size of the intermediaries have an effect on provisions. The predominant effect however is that provisions and actual losses are negatively related to past economic growth and positively related to past aggregate credit growth. We also estimate the forward and backward-looking component of provisions, finding that provisions respond mainly to past reported losses. These findings suggest that EME banks' provisioning decisions are highly correlated. Since provisions fall when output grows, macroprudential tools that counter this effect could dampen pro-cyclical behavior.</p>

<p>Could a less conservative central bank - one that faces a more severe time inconsistency problem - be less likely to succumb to an attack on a currency peg? Traditional currency-crisis models provide a firm answer: No. We argue that the answer stems from these models' narrow focus on how a central bank's response to a speculative attack affects output and inflation in the short run. The answer may reverse if we recognize that a credible currency peg solves time consistency issues in the long run. As a less conservative central bank stands to benefit more from tying its own hands, it should find a peg more valuable.</p>

<p>In contrast to the benign neglect of the financial system in traditional monetary models, there has been growing evidence in recent years that the size and the structure of financial intermediation play a critical role in the transmission of monetary policy. This paper reviews the implications of three key post-2008 crisis developments in financial intermediation - the role of banks, the globalisation of debt markets and the sustained decline in global long-term interest rates - for various transmission channels of monetary policy in EMEs. The paper argues that the globalisation of debt markets means that monetary policy can no longer be conducted through the short-term interest rate alone. This raises questions about the appropriate instruments to be used for economic stabilisation in this new environment.</p>

This paper attempts to explain these phenomena within a textbook DSGE model that features a non-trivial banking sector. In the model, banks are heterogeneous with respect to their intermediation skills, which gives rise to an interbank market. Moral hazard and asymmetric information in this market may lead to sudden interbank market freezes, banking crises, credit crunches and severe recessions. Those "financial" recessions follow credit booms and are not triggered by large exogenous adverse shocks.</p>

<p>A stronger macroeconomic position when the financial crisis erupted allowed Latin American economies to mitigate its impact through fiscal expansions, reversing the characteristic procyclical behaviour of fiscal policy. At the same time, in the last two decades fiscal rules have been extensively adopted in the region. This paper analyses the stabilising role of discretionary fiscal policy over time, and the role of fiscal financing conditions and fiscal rules in this evolution in a sample of eight Latin American economies. The analysis shows three main results: i) fiscal policies became countercyclical during the crisis, but they have turned procyclical again in recent years; ii) financing conditions are confirmed to be a key driver of the fiscal stance, but their relevance has recently diminished; and iii) fiscal rules are associated with a more stabilising role for fiscal policy.</p>

This refinement did not affect bank all-in ratings, which measure default risk by combining standalone ratings with assessments of extraordinary sovereign support.

<p>When global investors go into emerging markets or get out of them, how do they differentiate between economies? Has this behaviour changed since the crisis of 2008 to reflect a "new normal"? We consider these questions by focusing on sovereign risk as reflected in monthly returns on credit default swaps (CDS) for 18 emerging markets and 10 developed countries. Tests for breaks in the time series of such returns suggest a new normal that ensued around October 2008 or soon afterwards. Dividing the sample into two periods and extracting risk factors from CDS returns, we find an "old normal" in which a single global risk factor drives half of the variation in returns and a new normal in which that risk factor becomes even more dominant. Surprisingly, in both the old and new normal, the way countries load on this factor depends not so much on economic fundamentals as on whether they are designated an emerging market.</p>

<p>This paper explores the nature of macroeconomic spillovers from advanced economies to emerging market economies (EMEs) and the consequences for independent use of monetary policy in EMEs. We first empirically document the effects of US monetary policy shocks on a sample group of EMEs. A contractionary monetary shock leads a retrenchment in EME capital flows, a fall in EME GDP, and an exchange rate depreciation. We construct a theoretical model which can help to account for these findings. In the model, macroeconomic spillovers are exacerbated by financial frictions. We assess the extent to which domestic monetary policy can mitigate the negative spillovers from foreign shocks. Absent financial frictions, international spillovers are minor, and an inflation targeting rule represents an effective policy for the EME. With frictions in financial intermediation, however, spillovers are substantially magnified, and an inflation targeting rule has little advantage over an exchange rate peg. However, an optimal monetary policy markedly improves on the performance of naive inflation targeting or an exchange rate peg. Furthermore, optimal policies don't need to be coordinated across countries. Under the specific set of assumptions maintained in our model, a non-cooperative, self-oriented optimal policy gives results very similar to those of a global cooperative optimal policy.</p>

The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using output, price and bilateral trade data from the US and the Eurozone. The estimation exercise shows that trade finance conditions, which in turn are driven by US interest rates, are critical in explaining economic fluctuations. Quantitatively, trade finance has a larger impact on spillover effects of shocks to foreign countries, implying that incorporation of trade finance is particularly important when modeling small open economies.</p>

<p>Since the global financial crisis of 2008, macroprudential instruments have attracted an increasing amount of attention as potentially the best tools for stabilizing boom-and-bust cycles. This is because, in contrast to short-term interest rates, macroprudential instruments are regarded as particularly precise tools that act only on the area of concern. In this paper, we conduct an empirical examination to determine if this is the case by studying relevant areas of the Japanese economy from the 1970s to 1990s. We focus on a policy instrument called Quantitative Restriction (QR) implemented by the government. QR explicitly required banks to curb their lending to the real estate industry and related activities, and was used in the wake of the credit boom. We construct shocks to QR using narrative records of the government, and estimate their impact on the macroeconomy. We find that QR affected the aggregate economy as well as the real estate sector and land prices. In order to see why QR was a "blunt" instrument, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis using individual bank data and disaggregated industry group data. We find evidence that shocks to QR affected the aggregate economy by damaging the balance sheets of banks and non-financial firms.</p>

<p>The unit banking structure of the United States gave rise to a uniquely important interbank correspondent network, which linked banks throughout the country during the National Banking Era. During normal times, these interbank network relationships provided banks with access to money markets, facilitated payment processing, and helped banks meet legal reserve requirements. We collect and analyze data on individual correspondent relationships of national banks to map the structure of the network, identify the factors that led banks to adopt different correspondent network structures, and examine the consequences of network choices for bank liquidity risk. Banks' network profiles differed according to the range of services they needed or provided to their customers. For instance, banks providing more checking services focused their interbank relationships on banks in New York City, which was central to the payment clearing system. Location characteristics also mattered; banks in areas with more manufacturing firms maintained more network connections. Differences in network profiles propagated liquidity risk during the Panic of 1893, one of the most severe panics of the National Banking Era. Banks with relatively high two-sided interbank liquidity risk - those that both held more of their liquid assets with their correspondents and were funded to a greater extent by the deposits of other banks - were more likely to close. New York City banks suspended convertibility during the crisis. Banks that relied more heavily on New York correspondents as a source of liquidity were more likely to close.</p>

<p>We investigate the link between credit booms, productivity growth, labour reallocations and financial crises in a sample of over twenty advanced economies and over forty years. We produce two key findings. First, credit booms tend to undermine productivity growth by inducing labour reallocations towards lower productivity growth sectors. A temporarily bloated construction sector stands out as an example. Second, the impact of reallocations that occur during a boom, and during economic expansions more generally, is much larger if a crisis follows. In other words, when economic conditions become more hostile, misallocations beget misallocations. These findings have broader implications: they shed light on the recent secular stagnation debate; they provide an alternative interpretation of hysteresis effects; they highlight the need to incorporate credit developments in the measurement of potential output; and they provide a new perspective on the medium- to long-run impact of monetary policy as well as its ability to fight post-crisis recessions.</p>

This raises the question of how central banks deal with policy trade-offs resulting from potential conflicts between price and financial stability objectives. We analyse this issue in the Asia-Pacific region, where many economies with inflation targeting central banks have adopted macroprudential policies in order to safeguard financial stability. Using structural vector autoregressions that identify both monetary and macroprudential policy actions, our results highlight similarities in the effects of monetary and macroprudential policies on the real economy. Tighter macroprudential policies used to contain credit growth have also had a negative impact on output and inflation.

<p>We study the feedback from the risk of outstanding mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on the level and volatility of interest rates. We incorporate the supply shocks resulting from changes in MBS duration into a parsimonious equilibrium dynamic term structure model and derive three predictions that are strongly supported in the data: (i) MBS duration positively predicts nominal and real excess bond returns, especially for longer maturities; (ii) the predictive power of MBS duration is transitory in nature; and (iii) MBS convexity increases interest rate volatility, and this effect has a hump-shaped term structure.</p>

<p>We propose a new, data-based test for the presence of biased financial advice when households choose between fixed and adjustable rate mortgages. If households are wary, the relative cost of the two types should be a sufficient statistic for a household contract choice: the attributes of the bank that makes the loan should play no role. If households rely on banks' advice to guide their choice, banks may be tempted to bias their counsel to their own advantage. In this case bank-specific supply characteristics will play a role in the household's choice above any role they play through relative prices. Testing this hypothesis on a sample of 1.6 million mortgages originated in Italy between 2004 and 2010, we find that the choice between adjustable and fixed rates is significantly affected by change in banks' supply factors, especially in periods during which banks do not change the relative price of the two mortgage types. This supports the view that banks are able to affect customers' mortgage choices not only by pricing but also through an advice channel.</p>

<p>The primary driver of commercial bank failures during the Great Recession was exposure to the real estate sector, not aggregate funding strains. The main "toxic" exposure was credit to non-household real estate borrowers, not traditional home mortgages or agency MBS. Private-label MBS contributed to the failure of large banks only. Failed banks skewed their portfolios towards product categories that performed poorly on aggregate. In addition, within each product category they held assets of lower quality than those held by survivor banks.</p>

<p>We present a search-based model of the interbank money market and monetary policy implementation. Banks are subject to reserve requirements and the central bank tenders reserves. Interbank payments redistribute holdings and banks trade with each other in a decentralized (over-the-counter) market. The central bank provides standing facilities where banks can either deposit surpluses or borrow to cover shortfalls of reserves overnight. The model provides insights on liquidity, trading volume, and rate dispersion in the interbank market - features largely absent from the canonical models in the tradition of Poole (1968) - and fits a number of stylized facts for the Eurosystem observed during the recent period of unconventional monetary policies. Moreover, it provides insights on the implications of different market structures.</p>

<p>We document empirically that the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis exposed emerging market economies (EMEs) to an adverse feedback loop of capital outflows, depreciating exchange rates, deteriorating balance sheets, rising credit spreads and falling real economic activity. In order to account for these empirical findings, we build a New-Keynesian DSGE model of a small open economy with a banking sector that has access to both domestic and foreign funding. Using the calibrated model, we investigate optimal, simple and operational monetary policy rules that respond to domestic/external financial variables alongside inflation and output. The Ramsey-optimal policy rule is used as a benchmark. The results suggest that such an optimal policy rule features direct and non-negligible responses to lending spreads over the cost of foreign debt, the real exchange rate and the US policy rate, together with a mild anti-inflationary policy stance in response to domestic and external shocks. Optimal policy faces trade-offs in smoothing inefficient fluctuations in the intratemporal and intertemporal wedges driven by inflation, credit spreads and the real exchange rate. In response to productivity and external shocks, a countercyclical reserve requirement (RR) rule used in coordination with a conventional interest rate rule attains welfare levels comparable to those implied by spread- and real exchange rate-augmented rules.</p>

Combining estimated yield responses obtained using high-frequency data with model estimates using monthly data, we show that bond yields move after announcements mostly because of revisions to expectations about short-term interest rates. Changes in risk premia are also sizable, partly offset the effects of short-rate expectations and help to account for the hump-shaped pattern across maturities. Most announcement responses are due to changes in expectations about the output gap.</p>

In the process, it revisits the Lucas paradox, the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle and the notion of sudden stops. It argues that, in a world of huge and free capital flows, the centrality of current accounts in international finance, and hence in academic and policy debates, should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>The traditional approach to international finance is to view capital flows as the financial counterpart to savings and investment decisions, assuming further that the GDP boundary defines both the decision-making unit and the currency area. This "triple coincidence" of GDP area, decision-making unit and currency area is an elegant simplification but misleads when financial flows are important in their own right. First, the neglect of gross flows, when only net flows are considered, can lead to misdiagnoses of financial vulnerability. Second, inattention to the effects of international currencies may lead to erroneous conclusions on exchange rate adjustment. Third, sectoral differences between corporate and official sector positions can distort welfare conclusions on the consequences of currency depreciation, as macroeconomic risks may be underestimated. This paper illustrates the pitfalls of the triple coincidence through a series of examples from the global financial system in recent years and examines alternative analytical frameworks based on balance sheets as the unit of analysis.</p>

<p>We model inflation forecasts as monotonically diverging from an estimated long-run anchor point towards actual inflation as the forecast horizon shortens. Fitting the model with forecaster-level data for Canada and the US, we identify three key differences between the two countries. First, the average estimated anchor of US inflation forecasts has tended to decline gradually over time in rolling samples, from 3.4% for 1989-1998 to 2.2% for 2004-2013. By contrast, it has remained close to 2% since the mid-1990 for Canadian forecasts. Second, the variance of estimates of the long-run anchor is considerably lower for the panel of Canadian forecasters than US ones following Canada's adoption of inflation targets. And third, forecasters in Canada look much more alike than those in the US in terms of the weight that they place on the anchor. One explanation for these results is that an explicit inflation targeting regime (Canada) provides for less uncertainty about future monetary policy actions than a monetary policy regime where there was no explicit numerical inflation target (the US before 2012) to anchor expectations.</p>

<p>This paper investigates if informational monopolies resulting from relationship lending and bank market concentration allow for rent extraction through collateral. Our identification strategy hinges on the notion that informational equalization shocks (such as equity IPOs) erode rent seeking opportunities, while competing theories do not rely on information asymmetries among lenders. Using a unique hand-collected database of 9,288 bank loans obtained by 649 listed Chinese firms, we find that collateral incidence is positively associated with relationship intensity and bank market concentration, while this effect is moderated for post-IPO loans. These results are obtained controlling for a large number of loan and firm characteristics, monetary policy variables and regional macroeconomic characteristics. We also demonstrate important cross-sectional variation among borrowing firms: rent extraction through collateral is significantly less pronounced for less risky firms. Our results hold for a battery of robustness tests, both included in the paper and in an Internet appendix (available upon request). Furthermore, we provide new evidence on the determinants of collateral in Chinese bank lending markets.</p>

Expected inflation interacts with corporate taxation through the deductibility of i) capital expenditures at historical value and ii) interest payments on debt. Through the first channel, inflation increases firms' taxable profits and further distorts their investment decisions. Through the second, expected inflation affects the effective real interest rate, relaxes firms' financial constraints and stimulates investment. We show that, in the presence of collateralized debt, the second effect dominates. Therefore, in contrast to earlier literature, we find that when the tax code creates an advantage of debt financing, a positive rate of long-run inflation is beneficial in terms of welfare as it mitigates the financial distortion and spurs capital accumulation.</span></p>

<p>Long-term interest rates in Europe fell sharply in 2014 to historically low levels. This development is often attributed to yield-chasing in anticipation of quantitative easing (QE) by the European Central Bank (ECB). We examine how portfolio adjustments by long-term investors aimed at containing duration mismatches may have acted as an amplification mechanism in this process. Declining long-term interest rates tend to widen the negative duration gap between the assets and liabilities of insurers and pension funds, and any attempted rebalancing by increasing asset duration results in further downward pressure on interest rates. Evidence from the German insurance sector is consistent with such an amplification mechanism.</p>

<p>Has financial globalisation compromised central banks' ability to manage domestic financial conditions? This paper tackles this question by studying the dynamics of bond yields encompassing 31 advanced and emerging market economies. To gauge the extent to which external financial conditions complicate the conduct of monetary policy, we isolate a "contagion" component by focusing on comovements in measures of bond return risk premia that are unrelated to economic fundamentals. Our contagion measure is designed to more accurately capture spillovers driven by exogenous global shifts in risk preference or appetite. The analysis reaches several conclusions that run counter to popular presumptions based on comovements in bond yields. In particular, emerging market economies appear to be much less susceptible to global contagion than advanced economies, and the overall sensitivities to contagion have not increased post-crisis.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the microeconomic determinants of leverage decisions by asset managers. Investment funds (the "buy side") have significantly increased their share of global capital flows in recent years. Unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies have squeezed returns while reducing borrowing costs, which in principle creates an incentive for asset managers to use more leverage. We start by studying the recent behaviour of fund leverage in different asset categories at an aggregate level. Leverage appears to have increased significantly in funds focused on the fixed income markets of emerging economies. Then we analyse the microeconomic factors that shape the leverage decision. In line with theory, we find that leverage rises with expected returns, and falls with market risk and borrowing costs. Transaction costs are also mentioned in the literature as another factor that should inhibit leverage. Lacking the requisite data, we introduce as proxies changes in capital controls and macroprudential policies, because they tend to affect expected returns in comparable ways. We find that tighter capital controls on inflows increase leverage rather than decrease it, but that macroprudential measures have no discernible effect. Finally, we discuss these results and their policy implications.</p>

<p>Collateral constraints widely used in models of financial crises feature a pecuniary externality: Agents do not internalize how borrowing decisions taken in "good times" affect collateral prices during a crisis. We show that agents in a competitive equilibrium borrow more than a financial regulator who internalizes this externality. We also find, however, that under commitment the regulator's plans are time-inconsistent, and hence focus on studying optimal, time-consistent policy without commitment. This policy features a state-contingent macroprudential debt tax that is strictly positive at date <em>t</em> if a crisis has positive probability at <em>t</em> + 1. Quantitatively, this policy reduces sharply the frequency and magnitude of crises, removes fat tails from the distribution of returns, and increases social welfare. In contrast, constant debt taxes are ineffective and can be welfare-reducing, while an optimized "macroprudential Taylor rule" is eeffective but less so than the optimal policy.</p>

<p>This paper investigates how monetary policy affects bank profitability. We use data for 109 large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1995-2012. Overall, we find a positive relationship between the level of short-term rates and the slope of the yield curve (the "interest rate structure", for short), on the one hand, and bank profitability - return on assets - on the other. This suggests that the positive impact of the interest rate structure on net interest income dominates the negative one on loan loss provisions and on non-interest income. We also find that the effect is stronger when the interest rate level is lower and the slope less steep, ie that non-linearities are present. All this suggests that, over time, unusually low interest rates and an unusually flat term structure erode bank profitability.</p>

<p>This paper is one of the first to investigate the determinants of bond issuance by European banks. We use a unique database of around 50,000 bonds issued by 63 banks from 14 European countries, allowing us to differentiate between different types of long-term debt securities. By investigating at the individual bank level, we are able to test explicitly a broad set of hypotheses from both the corporate finance and banking literature on the drivers of bond issuance. We use both country and bank-specific financial characteristics as explanatory variables. With respect to the country determinants, our findings suggest that "market timing" (low interest rates) drove issuance before but not during the crisis, when access to funding became more important than its cost. Moreover, during the crisis years, country-risk characteristics became drivers of bond issuance, while for banks from the euro area periphery central bank liquidity substituted for unsecured long-term debt. We also show that heightened financial market tensions were detrimental to bond issuance, and more strongly so during crisis episodes. Our results yield strongly significant coefficients for the bank-specific variables, with signs as expected. We find evidence of "leverage targeting" by issuing long-term debt during the crisis years. The positive and significant coefficient for the capital ratio supports the "risk absorption" hypothesis, suggesting that larger capital buffers enhanced the risk-bearing capacity of banks and allowed them to issue more debt. Moreover, banks with deposit supply constraints and relatively large loan portfolios issued more bonds, both before and since the crisis years. We also find that higher rated banks were more likely to issue bonds, also during the crisis period. Stronger banks issued especially unsecured debt, while weaker banks resorted more to issuance of covered bonds. Overall, our results suggest that stronger banks - including those from peripheral countries - maintained better access to longer-term funding markets, even during crisis periods.

<p>This paper explores the role of international reserves as a stabiliser of international capital flows, in particular during periods of global financial stress. In contrast with previous contributions, aimed at explaining net capital flows, we focus on the behaviour of gross capital flows. We analyse an extensive cross-country quarterly database, comprising 63 countries for the period 1991-2010, using standard panel regressions. We document significant heterogeneity in the response of resident investors to financial stress and relate it to a previously undocumented channel through which reserves act as a buffer during financial stress. A robust result of the analysis is that international reserves facilitate financial disinvestment overseas by residents - a fall in capital outflows. This partially offsets the drop in foreign capital inflows observed in such periods. For the whole sample, we also find that larger stocks of international reserves are linked to higher gross inflows and lower gross outflows. These results, which challenge current approaches to measuring reserve adequacy, call for refining such tools to better account for the role of resident investors.</p>

<p>How has the CCB affected mortgage pricing after Switzerland became the first country to activate this Basel III macroprudential tool? By analyzing a database with several offers per mortgage request, we construct a picture of mortgage supply and demand. We find, first, that the CCB changes the composition of mortgage supply, as relatively capital-constrained and mortgage-specialized banks raise prices more than their competitors do. Second, risk-weighting schemes linked to borrower risk do not amplify the CCB's effect. To conclude, changes in the supply composition suggest that the CCB has achieved its intended effect in shifting mortgages from less resilient to more resilient banks, but stricter capital requirements do not appear to have discouraged less resilient banks from risky mortgage lending.</p>

<p>Lending to emerging market economies (EMEs) through bond purchases has surged since 2009. What are the risks of a sudden stop? Bond mutual funds may curtail credit through two channels. The first is redemptions by ultimate investors. The second is additional discretionary sales by fund managers, over and above any sales implied by redemptions. In an empirical analysis of EME bond funds, we find that discretionary sales tend to reinforce the sales due to investor redemptions, and that 100 dollars' worth of bond sales due to investor redemptions is accompanied by roughly 10 dollars' worth of discretionary bond sales. We also find that 100 dollars' worth of EME international bond sales is associated with around 4 dollars' worth of valuation losses.

<p>Financial conditions in the emerging markets (EMs) have become more dependent on the 'world' long-term interest rate, which has been driven down by monetary policies in the advanced economies - notably Quantitative Easing (QE) - and by several non-monetary factors. This paper analyses some new mechanisms that link global long-term rates to monetary policy and to domestic bank lending in the EMs. Understanding these mechanisms could help EM central banks prepare for the exit from QE and higher (and perhaps divergent) policy rates in advanced economies. Although monetary policy in the EMs has continued to be guided by domestic objectives, it has nevertheless lost some traction. Difficult trade-offs now confront central banks.</p>

<p>Colombia is a small open and commodity exporter economy, sensitive to international commodity price fluctuations. During the surge in commodity prices, as income from the resource sector increases total credit expands, boosting demand for tradable and nontradable goods, appreciating the currency and shifting resources from the tradable sector to the nontradable. Although this adjustment is efficient, the presence of financial frictions in the economy exacerbates the resource allocation process through credit. In this phase, as total credit expands, the appreciation erodes the net worth of the tradable sector and boosts the nontradable one, and thus credit gets concentrated in that sector. A sudden reversal of commodity prices causes a rapid adjustment of resources in the opposite direction. However, the ability of the tradable sector to absorb the freed resources is limited by its financial capacity. In this scenario, macroprudential policies may help to restrain aggregate credit dynamics and thus prevent or act prudently in anticipation to the effects of large oil price shock reversals. In this work we write a model that accounts for these facts and quantify the role of three policy instruments: short term interest rate, FX intervention and financial regulation. We explore this issues in a DSGE model estimated for the Colombian economy and find that both FX intervention and regulation policies complement the short-term interest rates in smoothing the business cycle by restraining credit, raising market interest rates and smoothing economic activity. However, these additional instruments have undesirable sectoral implications. In particular, the use of these policies implies that credit to the tradable sector dries and becomes more expensive, weakening its financial position, which in turn implies a sharper fall of this sector during the price reversal and a longer recovery. These effects, nonetheless, appear to be quantitatively small according to the estimated model.</p>

<p>The unconventional shocks and non-linear dynamics behind the high volatility of financial markets present a challenge for the implementation of macroprudential policy. This paper introduces two of these unconventional shocks, news shocks about future fundamentals and regime changes in global liquidity, into a quantitative non-linear model of financial crises. The model is then used to examine how these shocks affect the design and effectiveness of optimal macroprudential policy. The results show that both shocks contribute to strengthen the amplification mechanism driving financial crisis dynamics. Macroprudential policy is effective for reducing the likelihood and magnitude of financial crises, but the optimal policy requires significant variation across regimes of global liquidity and realizations of news shocks. Moreover, the effectiveness of the policy improves as the precision of news rises from low levels, but at high levels of precision it becomes less effective (financial crises are less likely, but the optimal policy does not weaken them significantly).</p>

We estimate the model using Bayesian techniques with quarterly data for Argentina in 2003-2011; it can be extended to other emerging economies, allowing for comparative empirical analysis. Results indicate that shocks to lending rates and spread weigh on macroeconomic variables; likewise, the credit market is affected by macroeconomic shocks. Capital requirements, beyond their strictly prudential role, appear to have contributed to lower volatility of key variables such as output, prices, credit and interest rates. The interaction of monetary policy, foreign exchange intervention and prudential tools appears to be synergic: counting on a larger set of tools helps dampen volatility of both macroeconomic and financial system variables, taking into account the type of shocks faced during the estimation period.</p>

<p>Experience from financial crises and central bank policies in the past decade has led to an intensified debate about the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability. Since there is no established theoretical framework for analysing the links between financial stability and monetary policy, it is very difficult to deliver precise recommendations for policy. The primary purpose of this paper is to present suggestions for how risks of financial instability can be taken into account in the information provided to central bank decision makers, despite the considerable uncertainty about the appropriate analytical approach. The paper starts with a discussion of the strategy of "flexible inflation targeting", which, in fact, does not provide any "simple rules" for policymakers. The next section contains a review of theoretical and empirical analyses of links between financial stability and monetary policy. Insights from inflation targeting, and more recent views on the role of financial stability, lead to suggestions regarding the type of information that should be presented to monetary policy decision makers, and how it can be organised, to help them understand the links between financial stability and monetary policy.</p>

We also find some evidence of spillover effects of these policies. Finally, regarding the interaction of monetary policy and macroprudential policies, our empirical findings suggest that macroprudential policies are more successful when they complement monetary policy by reinforcing monetary tightening, than when they act in opposite directions.</p>

<p>This paper examines past evidence of prolonged periods of foreign exchange reserves accumulation in the Asia-Pacific region. One empirical challenge is to identify periods of reserve accumulation that are sufficiently large and persistent to be categorised as prolonged. Several proxies for prolonged episodes are considered, including a newly proposed one based on a factor model. We then identify the key macrofinancial determinants of prolonged reserve accumulation. Two broad conclusions emerge from the stylised facts and the econometric evidence. First, the best protection against costly reserves accumulation is a more flexible exchange rate. Second, the necessity of accumulating reserves as a bulwark against goods price inflation is misplaced. Instead, there is a strong link between asset price movements and the likelihood of accumulating foreign exchange reserves that are costly. Policy implications are also drawn.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange intervention has been actively used as a policy tool in many economies in Asia and elsewhere. In this paper, we examine two intervention rules (leaning against exchange rate misalignment and leaning against the wind), utilised with varying degrees of transparency, based on a simple model with three kinds of agents: fundamentalists, speculators and the central bank. We assess the effectiveness of these rules against five criteria: stabilising the exchange rate, reducing current account imbalances, discouraging speculation, minimising reserves volatility and limiting intervention costs. Overall we find no dominant intervention strategy. Intervention that reduces exchange rate volatility, for example, also reduces the risks of speculation, creating a feedback loop and potentially leading to high levels of speculation, reserves volatility and intervention costs. These intervention costs will be especially large when exchange rate movements are driven by interest rate shocks, although some degree of opaqueness can help to reduce them. Survey evidence from BIS (2005, 2013) indicates that central banks follow a range of different strategies when intervening in foreign exchange rates. Given the trade-offs that different strategies entail in our model, this is not surprising.</p>

<p>This paper studies the choice between building liquidity buffers and raising funding ex post, to deal with liquidity shocks. We uncover the possibility of an inefficient liquidity squeeze equilibrium. Agents typically choose to build smaller liquidity buffers when they expect cheap funding. However, when agents hold smaller liquidity buffers, they can raise less funding because of limited pledgeability, which in the aggregate depresses the funding cost. This incentive structure yields multiple equilibria, one being an inefficient liquidity squeeze equilibrium where agents do not build any liquidity buffer. Comparative statics show that this inefficient equilibrium is more likely when the supply of funding is large, and/or when aggregate shocks display low volatility. Last, the effectiveness of policy options to restore efficiency is limited because the net gain to intervention decreases with the availability of funding. In other words, policy becomes ineffective when the equilibrium becomes inefficient.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that limits on loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios can stabilise the housing market, and that tightening these limits tends to be more effective than loosening them. This paper examines whether the relative effectiveness of tightening vs. loosening macroprudential measures depends on where in the housing cycle they are implemented. I find that tightening measures have greater effects when credit is expanding quickly and when house prices are high relative to income. Loosening measures seem to have smaller effects than tightening, but the difference is negligible in downturns. Loosening being found to have small effects is consistent with where it occurs in the cycle.</p>

<p>The departure from the Modigliani-Miller conditions, due for instance to market incompleteness, asymmetric information or taxation, tends to increase the importance of indirect channels by which monetary policy affects the level of economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs). The bank lending channel highlighted by Bernanke and Blinder (1988) is a prominent example of such indirect effect of monetary policy. In this study we investigate how the bank lending channel acts above and beyond the traditional money channel that most macroeconomic models emphasize. We find that, particularly in EMEs with high bank reliance, changes in the volume of bank credit are important drivers of fixed capital formation. Using micro-level bank balance sheet data, we then show how monetary policy and sovereign risk premia affected bank credit growth in EMEs between 2001 and 2013. We find that both, changes in the monetary policy stance and changes in risk premia have had significant effects on credit volumes. Furthermore, we show that these effects tend to affect smaller banks more strongly. Our results suggest that the accommodative monetary policies that have been seen recently were contributing factors to the rapid expansion of credit in many EMEs.</p>

First, we find the QE impact from reducing the US corporate spread to be more important than that from lowering the US term spread, consistent with Blinder's (2012) argument. Second, counterfactual exercises suggest that US QE measures, especially the cumulative effects of successive QE measures starting with the sizeable impact of the early actions, countered forces that could have led to episodes of prolonged recession and deflation in the advanced economies. Third, the estimated effects on emerging economies are diverse but generally larger than those found for the United States and other advanced economies. The estimates suggest that US monetary policy spillovers contributed to overheating in Brazil, China and some other emerging economies in 2010 and 2011, but supported their respective recoveries in 2009 and 2012.

<p>During the 2007-09 financial crisis, there were severe reductions in the liquidity of financial markets, runs on the shadow banking system, and destabilizing defaults and near-defaults of major financial institutions. In response, the Federal Reserve, in its role as lender of last resort (LOLR), injected extraordinary amounts of liquidity. In the aftermath, lawmakers and regulators have taken steps to reduce the likelihood that such lending would be required in the future, including the introduction of liquidity regulations. These changes were motivated in part by the argument that central bank lending entails extremely high costs and should be made unnecessary by liquidity regulations. By contrast, some have argued that the loss of liquidity was the result of market failures, and that central banks can solve such failures by lending, making liquidity regulations unnecessary. In this paper, we argue that LOLR lending and liquidity regulations are complementary tools. Liquidity shortfalls can arise for two very different reasons: First, sound institutions can face runs or a deterioration in the liquidity of markets they depend on for funding. Second, solvency concerns can cause creditors to pull away from troubled institutions. Using examples from the recent crisis, we argue that central bank lending is the best response in the former situation, while orderly resolution (by the institution as it gets through the problem on its own or via a controlled failure) is the best response in the second situation. We also contend that liquidity regulations are a necessary tool in both situations: They help ensure that the authorities will have time to assess the nature of the shortfall and arrange the appropriate response, and they provide an incentive for banks to internalize the externalities associated with any liquidity risks.</p>

<p>Renminbi internationalisation has brought about an active offshore market where the exchange rate frequently diverges from the onshore market. Using extended GARCH models, we explore the role of fundamentals, global factors and policies related to renminbi internationalisation in driving the pricing differential between the onshore and offshore exchange rates. Differences in the liquidity of the two markets play an important role in explaining the level of the differential, while rises in global risk aversion tend to increase the differential's volatility. On the policy front, measures permitting cross-border renminbi outflows have a particularly discernible impact in reducing the volatility of the pricing gap between the two markets.</p>

<p>We introduce a structural dynamic network model of the formation of lending relationships in the unsecured interbank market. Banks are subject to random liquidity shocks and can form links with potential trading partners to bilaterally Nash bargain about loan conditions. To reduce credit risk uncertainty, banks can engage in costly peer monitoring of counterparties. We estimate the structural model parameters by indirect inference using network statistics of the Dutch interbank market from 2008 to 2011. The estimated model accurately explains the high sparsity and stability of the lending network. In particular, peer monitoring and credit risk uncertainty are key factors in the formation of stable interbank lending relationships that are associated with improved credit conditions. Moreover, the estimated degree distribution of the lending network is highly skewed with a few very interconnected core banks and many peripheral banks that trade mainly with core banks. Shocks to credit risk uncertainty can lead to extended periods of low market activity, amplified by a reduction in peer monitoring. Finally, our monetary policy analysis shows that a wider interest rate corridor leads to a more active market through a direct effect on the outside options and an indirect multiplier effect by increasing banks' monitoring and search efforts.</p>

<p>In this paper we examine the negative relationship between the rate of growth of the financial sector and the rate of growth of total factor productivity. We begin by showing that by disproportionately benefiting high collateral/low productivity projects, an exogenous increase in finance reduces total factor productivity growth. Then, in a model with skilled workers and endogenous financial sector growth, we establish the possibility of multiple equilibria. In the equilibrium where skilled labour works in finance, the financial sector grows more quickly at the expense of the real economy. We go on to show that consistent with this theory, financial growth disproportionately harms financially dependent and R&amp;D-intensive industries.</p>

<p>In this paper, we use cross-industry, cross-country panel data to test whether industry growth is positively affected by the interaction between the reaction of real short-term interest rates to the business cycle and industry-level measures of financial constraints. Financial constraints are measured, either by the extent to which an industry is prone to being "credit-constrained", or by the extent to which it is prone to being "liquidity-constrained". Our main findings are that: (i) the interaction between credit or liquidity constraints and the counter-cyclical real short-term interest rate has a positive, significant, and robust impact on the average annual growth rate of industry labor productivity; (ii) these interaction effects tend to be more significant in recessions than in expansions.</p>

<p>A model of imperfectly competitive banks is examined under asymmetric information about borrower quality. Greater bank competition and a lower risk-free rate raise the screening costs of lending, which can result in pooling Nash equilibria with credit booms. Such equilibria are characterised by sharp increases in credit supply and deteriorations in average loan quality, which are inefficient for banks. In the model, banks' incentives to make risky loans can vary despite unchanged capital structure, thus highlighting the role of a risk-taking mechanism. This approach helps explain the existing mixed empirical results on the relationship between bank competition and financial stability. The model can be used to define a neutral interest rate in the context of financial cycles, namely a finance-neutral interest rate, which is estimated in the case of the United States.</p>

<p>Biofuel policies are frequently mentioned in the policy and academic debates because of their potential impact on food prices. In 2005, the United States authorities passed legislation under which corn-based ethanol became in practice the only available gasoline additive. Some studies have then argued that ethanol and biodiesel subsidies in advanced economies may have strengthened the link between the prices of oil and those of some food commodities. This paper tests whether the response of food commodity prices to global demand shocks and to oil-specific demand shocks has changed following the introduction of this legislation. Our results show that corn prices exhibit a stronger response to global demand shocks after 2006. Some short-lived but statistically significant response to oil-specific demand shocks is also documented. Close substitutes of corn in the feedstock business (eg soybeans and wheat) exhibit comparable but more muted responses, while other food commodities unaffected by biofuel policies do not change their behaviour. We also report some evidence that global liquidity is a factor driving global demand shocks, and through that channel may have affected food commodity prices.</p>

<p>The global finance crisis prompted central banks in many countries to cut short-term policy rates to near zero levels. Yet, lending rates did not fall as much as the decline in policy rates would have suggested. We argue that comparing lending rates to policy rates is misleading: banks do not obtain all their funds at policy rates, and after the crisis, costs of funding rose substantially. Comparing lending rates with a weighted average cost of funds suggests that banks did not substantially change their rate setting behaviour after the financial crisis: interest rate pass-through relationships across eleven countries in Europe appear to have remained stable.</p>

<p>Loan syndication increases bank interconnectedness through co-lending relationships. We study the financial stability implications of such dependency on syndicate partners in the presence of shocks to banks' capital. Model simulations in a network setting show that such shocks can produce rare events in this market when banks have shared loan exposures while also relying on a common risk management tool such as value-at-risk (VaR). This is because a withdrawal of a bank from a syndicate can cause ripple effects through the market, as the loan arranger scrambles to commit more of its own funds by also pulling back from other syndicates or has to dissolve the syndicate it had arranged. However, simulations also show that the core-periphery structure observed in the empirical network may reduce the probability of such contagion. In addition, simulations with tighter VaR constraints show banks taking on less risk ex-ante.</p>

<p>Since the global financial crisis, banks and bond investors have increased the outstanding US dollar credit to non-bank borrowers outside the United States from $6 trillion to $9 trillion. This increase has implications for understanding global liquidity and monetary policy transmission. We analyse the links between US monetary policy, leverage and flows into bond funds, on the one hand, and dollar credit extended to non-US borrowers, on the other. Prior to the crisis, global banks drew on low US dollar funding rates and easy leveraging to extend dollar credit to non-US borrowers. After the Federal Reserve announced its large-scale bond purchases in 2008, however, investors responded to compressed long-term US Treasury rates by buying higher yielding dollar bonds from non-US issuers. Thus, US unconventional monetary policy contributed to shifting the balance of dollar credit transmission from global banks to global bond investors.</p>

<p>There is considerable controversy over why sluggish economic growth persists across many advanced economies six years after the onset of the financial crisis. Theories include a secular deficiency in aggregate demand, slowing innovation, adverse demographics, lingering policy uncertainty, post-crisis political fractionalisation, debt overhang, insufficient fiscal stimulus, excessive financial regulation, and some mix of all of the above.

<p>The pre-crisis period was characterised by ample liquidity, a credit boom, and low yields in a wide range of asset classes. It was also defined by the accumulation of risks on and off the balance sheets of many financial intermediaries, particularly banks, as well as by a substantial increase in public and private sector debt in some countries. Understanding the relation between liquidity and the excessive accumulation of risks remains a central policy question. How do credit booms affect incentives? In the case of the government sector, credit booms may affect the incentives of different interest groups to agree on policies for reform or fiscal stabilisation. In the case of the private sector, it may change the incentives of originators to produce good assets. Credit booms complicate the evaluation of policies and agents and in addition may facilitate the entrenchment of interest groups and the deterioration of governance institutions.</p>

<p>This paper evaluates the capacity of emerging market economies (EMEs) to moderate the domestic impact of global financial and monetary forces through their own monetary policies. Those EMEs that are able to exploit a flexible exchange rate are far better positioned than those that devote monetary policy to fixing the rate - a reflection of the classical monetary policy trilemma. However, exchange rate changes alone do not insulate economies from foreign financial and monetary shocks. While potentially a potent source of economic benefits, financial globalisation does have a downside for economic management. It worsens the trade-offs monetary policy faces in navigating among multiple domestic objectives. This drawback of globalisation raises the marginal value of additional tools of macroeconomic and financial policy. Unfortunately, the availability of such tools is constrained by a financial policy trilemma that is distinct from the monetary trilemma. This second trilemma posits the incompatibility of national responsibility for financial policy, international financial integration and financial stability.</p>

<p>Money markets are fundamentally different from stock markets. Stock markets are about price discovery for the purpose of allocating risk efficiently. Money markets are about obviating the need for price discovery using over-collateralised debt to reduce the cost of lending. Yet, attempts to reform credit markets in the wake of the recent financial crisis often draw on insights grounded in our understanding of stock markets. This can be very misleading. The paper presents a perspective on the logic of credit markets and the structure of debt contracts that highlights the information insensitivity of debt. This perspective explains among other things why opacity often enhances liquidity in credit markets and therefore why all financial panics involve debt. These basic insights into the nature of debt and credit markets are simple but important for thinking about policies on transparency, on capital buffers and other regulatory issues concerning banking and money markets.</p>

It employs a panel VAR model to examine the impact of a very low US term premium on relatively small open Asian economies. The results show that unconventional US monetary policy spills over to Asia mainly through low domestic bond yields and rapid growth of domestic bank credit. Financial integration does not appear to reduce the control of national monetary authorities over short-term policy rates. However, it does compromise control over long-term rates that are key determinants of economic activity.

<p>Central banks of major advanced economies have maintained a very accommodative monetary policy stance in the last few years. However, concerns have surfaced that the transmission of low policy rates to lending rates has been weaker than in the past. Has the transmission of policy rates to lending rates been impaired by the Global Financial Crisis? To answer this question, we first estimate standard cointegrating equations linking policy and lending rates for non-financial firms in Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and United States. We then test for structural change in the cointegration parameters, reporting strong evidence of a break after Lehman Brothers' default. Such structural break is due to a strong increase in the mark-up between the lending rate and the policy rate that standard models assume constant in the long run. The structural shift is explained by compounding the lending rate equation with measures of risk.</p>

<p>Limited access to the formal financial sector is a common feature of the economic environment in many emerging market and developing economies. In this paper, we examine how the level of financial inclusion affects welfare-maximising monetary policy. Our theoretical framework is based on Galí, López-Salido and Vallés (2004). In this model, only financially included households are able to borrow and save to smooth consumption in the face of income volatility. We show that optimal monetary policy implies a positive relationship between the share of financially included households and the ratio of output volatility to inflation volatility. We find strong empirical support for the model's predictions using a broad cross-country dataset on financial inclusion. The  empirical results are driven primarily by central banks with a high degree of autonomy in their monetary policy decisions, who might be most likely to set monetary policy optimally.</p>

This paper shows that young firms are also key contributors to profit growth across advanced economies. It them examines the impact of financial constraints on profitability across the age distribution of SMEs. We find that start-ups which report finance as their greatest constraint receive smaller new loans and evidence that financing constraints reduce start-up profitability. We do not find a similar relationship for older SMEs in pre-crisis data. Therefore, policy initiatives which ease financing constraints for start-ups could play an important role in boosting economic growth.

<p>Using a novel database on capital flow measures in Asia over 2004−2013, we investigate the impact of bond inflow measures on the cross-market correlations of weekly bond fund flows and of daily bond returns in 12 Asia-Pacific economies, after controlling for global, regional and local factors. We find that a bond inflow measure taken by a country tends to increase the correlation of bond flows into the country with those into other countries in the region. In particular, a country's policy actions to loosen (ie increase) bond inflows significantly increase bond flow correlations, but policy actions to tighten (ie decrease) bond inflows have no significant impact. We also find that bond inflow measures increase bond return correlations in the long run. These results can be explained by the signalling hypothesis, under which global investors expect that when a country takes a bond inflow measure other countries to take similar actions, so that they increase or decrease their investment in the region at the same time.</p>

<p class="Paragraph">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the effect of liquidity regulation on bank balance sheets. It takes advantage of the fact that not all banks were made subject to tighter liquidity regulation by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 2010. Under this new regulation a subset of banks operating in the UK were required to hold a sufficient stock of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to withstand two scenarios of stressed funding conditions. We find that banks adjusted both their asset and liability structures to meet tighter liquidity requirements. Banks increased the share of HQLA and funding from more stable UK non-financial deposits while reducing the share of short-term intra-financial loans and short-term wholesale funding. We do not find evidence that the tightening of liquidity regulation had an impact on the overall size of bank balance sheets or a detrimental impact on lending to the non-financial sector either through reduced lending supply or higher interest rates on loans. Overall, in response to tougher liquidity regulation, banks replaced claims on other financial institutions with cash, central bank reserves and government bonds - and so reduced the interconnectedness of the banking sector without affecting lending to the real economy.</p>

<p>This paper presents a framework to assess the relative importance of three key sources of productivity growth that research on international trade focuses on: (i) inter-industry specialisation; (ii) intra-industry reallocation of resources across heterogeneous firms, including firm entry and exit; and (iii) technological progress. Detailed data on Swiss manufacturing firms illustrate how the framework can be empirically applied. Based on this example, we find that intra-industry reallocations are the most important source of growth in aggregate total factor productivity, reflecting in particular the productivity growth of large, incumbent firms and the entry of new firms. That said, inter-industry specialisation and general technological progress remain important supplementary sources of growth in Swiss manufacturing.</p>

<p>Financial regulation is often framed as a question of economic efficiency. This paper, by contrast, puts the distributive implications of financial regulation at center stage. We develop a formal model in which the financial sector benefits from financial risk-taking by earning greater expected returns. However, risk-taking also increases the incidence of large losses that lead to credit crunches and impose negative externalities on the real economy. We describe a Pareto frontier along which different levels of risk-taking map into different levels of welfare for the two parties, pitting Main Street against Wall Street. A regulator has to trade off efficiency in the financial sector, which is aided by deregulation, against efficiency in the real economy, which is aided by tighter regulation and a more stable supply of credit. We also show that financial innovation, asymmetric compensation schemes, concentration in the banking system, and bailout expectations enable or encourage greater risk-taking and allocate greater surplus to Wall Street at the expense of Main Street.</p>

In the US dollar money market, private benchmarks long ago displaced government benchmarks. In the bond markets, evidence from organised exchanges and the Triennial Central Bank survey on over-the-counter (OTC) markets suggests that the benchmark is tipping from government bond futures to private interest rate swaps. The global financial crisis seems only to have interrupted this process in the US dollar bond market, the European sovereign bond strains may have accelerated it in the euro bond market; and the policy to clear centrally OTC trades does not seem to be impeding it. Cross-sectional analysis of 35 bond markets identifies bond market size and GDP per capita as key determinants of the existence of government bond futures.

<p align="LEFT">The headline consumer price inflation (CPI) is often considered too noisy, narrowly defined, and/or slowly available for policymaking. On the other hand, traditional core inflation measures may reduce volatility but do not address other issues and may even exclude important information. This paper develops a new underlying inflation gauge (UIG) for China which differentiates between trend and noise, is available daily and uses a broad set of variables that potentially influence inflation. Its construction follows the works at other major central banks, adopts the methodology of a dynamic factor model that extracts the lower frequency components as developed by Forni et al. (2000) and draws on the experience of the People's Bank of China in modelling inflation. The paper is the first application of this type of dynamic factor model for inflation to any large emerging market economy. Our UIG for China is less noisy but still closely tracks the headline CPI. It does not suffer from the excess volatility reduction that plagues traditional core inflation measures and instead provides additional information. Finally, when forecasting the headline CPI, our UIG for China outperforms traditional core measures over different samples.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Well anchored inflation expectations are considered to be a reflection of credible monetary policy. In the past, anchoring has been assessed using either long-run inflation surveys or break-even inflation rates on financial assets with long maturities. But neither of these is ideal. Here we propose an alternative measure of inflation anchoring that makes full use of readily available, multiple-horizon, fixedevent forecasts. We show that a model where forecasts are assumed to diverge away from a long-run anchor towards actual inflation as the forecast horizon shortens fits the data well. It also provides simple estimates of the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored. Based on our estimation results we argue that inflation expectations have become more tightly anchored over time in both inflation targeting economies and in those following other regimes. However, inflation targeting regimes have seen a greater change along three dimensions: the level of the anchor has fallen further; the tightness of anchoring has increased more; and the relationship between the anchor and actual inflation outcomes has weakened to a greater degree.</p>

<p align="LEFT">EM Asia has seen a transformation of its monetary policy environment over the past 2 decades. By far, the most relevant change has been the maturing of its financial systems and the growing relevance of the global financial cycle: financial inclusion has spread, financial markets have deepened and financial globalisation has linked domestic markets closer to international markets. One consequence of the maturing of the financial systems has been the weakening of the traditional case for the monetarist view of the roles of monetary and credit aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy: velocity has been unstable in ways similar to that in the advanced economies decades earlier; yet, longer-term monetary growth correlations with inflation are evident.</p>
<p>In addition, the maturing of the financial systems has elevated concerns of financial stability, as both a source of shocks and as something central banks have a responsibility for. These developments have been further complicated by monetary policy spillovers from the advanced economies. The challenge now is how best to integrate mandates for financial stability into monetary policy frameworks, both conceptually and practically. Moreover, the exchange rate choice is particularly relevant in EM Asia. While managed exchange rate regimes in EM Asia have been implemented with mixed success, the risks associated with the choice can be seen through the lens of aggregates based on central bank balance sheets. The size and growth of central bank balance sheets suggest an ongoing build-up in risks.</p>
<p>All this points to the need to consider alternatives to conventional inflation targeting frameworks. This paper lays out a policy framework based on a multi-pillar monetary policy approach as a potentially attractive alternative for EM Asia. The three pillars are based on economic, financial and exchange rate stability, respectively. This framework not only offers an alternative conceptual framework but also implies institutional reforms to ensure central banks take a longer term perspective when setting policy.</p>

<p align="LEFT">We construct a small-open-economy, New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with real-financial linkages to analyze the effects of financial shocks and macroprudential policies on the Canadian economy. Our model has four key features. First, it allows for non-trivial interactions between the balance sheets of households, firms and banks within a unified framework. Second, it incorporates a risk-taking channel by allowing the risk appetite of investors to depend on aggregate economic activity and funding conditions. Third, it incorporates long-term debt by allowing households and businesses to pay back their stock of debt over multiple periods. Fourth, it incorporates targeted and broader macroprudential instruments to analyze the interaction between macroprudential and monetary policy. The model also features nominal and real rigidities, and is calibrated to match dynamics in Canadian macroeconomic and financial data. We study the transmission of monetary policy and financial shocks in the model economy, and analyze the effectiveness of various policies in simultaneously achieving macroeconomic and financial stability. We find that, in terms of reducing household debt, more targeted tools such as loan-to-value regulations are the most effective and least costly, followed by bank capital regulations and monetary policy, respectively.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the transmission channel of macroprudential instruments in a closed economy DSGE model with a rich set of financial frictions. Banks' decisions on risky retail loan concessions are based on borrowers' capacity to settle their debt with labor income. We also introduce frictions in banks' optimal choices of balance sheet composition to better reproduce banks' strategic reactions to changes in funding costs, in risk perception and in the regulatory environment. The model is able to reproduce not only price effects from macroprudential policies, but also quantity effects. The model is estimated with Brazilian data using Bayesian techniques. Unanticipated changes in reserve requirements have important quantitative effects, especially on banks' optimal asset allocation and on the choice of funding. This result holds true even for required reserves deposited at the central bank that are remunerated at the base rate. Changes in required core capital substantially impact the real economy and banks' balance sheet. When there is a lag between announcements and actual implementation of increased capital requirement ratios, agents immediately engage in anticipatory behavior. Banks immediately start to retain dividends so as to smooth the impact of higher required capital on their assets, more particularly on loans. The impact on the real economy also shifts to nearer horizons. Announcements that allow the new regulation on required capital to be anticipated also improve banks' risk positions, since banks achieve higher capital adequacy ratios right after the announcement and throughout the impact period. The effects of regulatory changes to risk weights on bank assets are not constrained to impact the segment whose risk was reassessed. We compare the model responses with those generated by models with collateral constraints traditionally used in the literature. The choice of collateral constraint is found to have important implications for the transmission mechanisms.</p>

<p>This paper extends the model of Aoki et al. (2009) considering a two sector small open economy. We study the interaction of borrowing, asset prices, and spillovers between tradable and non-tradable sectors. Our results suggest that when it is difficult to enforce debtors to repay their debt unless it is secured by collateral, a productivity shock in the tradable sector generates an increase in asset prices and leverage that spills over to the non-tradable sector, generating an appreciation of the real exchange and an increase in domestic lending. Macro-prudential instruments are introduced under the form of cyclical loan-to-value ratios that limit the amount of capital that entrepreneurs can pledge as collateral. Cyclical taxes that respond to the movements in the price of non-tradable goods are analysed. Simulation results show that this type of instruments significantly lessen the amplifying effects of borrowing constraints on small open economies and consequently reduce output and asset price volatility.</p>

<p align="LEFT">In analysing the performance of the international monetary and financial system (IMFS), too much attention has been paid to the current account and far too little to the capital account. This is true of both formal analytical models and historical narratives. This approach may be reasonable when financial markets are highly segmented. But it is badly inadequate when they are closely integrated, as they have been most of the time since at least the second half of the 19th century. Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises - its "excess financial elasticity". And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis.</p>

<p align="LEFT">This essay argues that the Achilles heel of the international monetary and financial system is that it amplifies the "excess financial elasticity" of domestic policy regimes, ie it exacerbates their inability to prevent the build-up of financial imbalances, or outsize financial cycles, that lead to serious financial crises and macroeconomic dislocations. This excess financial elasticity view contrasts sharply with two more popular ones, which stress the failure of the system to prevent disruptive current account imbalances and its tendency to generate a structural shortage of safe assets - the "excess saving" and "excess demand for safe assets" views, respectively. In particular, the excess financial elasticity view highlights financial rather than current account imbalances and a persistent expansionary rather than contractionary bias in the system. The failure to adjust domestic policy regimes and their international interaction raises a number of risks: entrenching instability in the global system; returning to the modern-day equivalent of the divisive competitive devaluations of the interwar years; and, ultimately, triggering an epoch-defining seismic rupture in policy regimes, back to an era of trade and financial protectionism and, possibly, stagnation combined with inflation.</p>

Yet bilateral linkages are often unobserved, and <em>maximum entropy</em> serves as the leading method for estimating counterparty exposures. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that combines information-theoretic arguments with economic incentives to produce more realistic interbank networks that preserve important characteristics of the original interbank market. The method loads the most probable links with the largest exposures consistent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank, yielding networks with <em>minimum density</em>. When used in a stress-testing context, the minimum-density solution overestimates contagion, whereas maximum entropy underestimates it. Using the two benchmarks side by side defines a useful range that bounds the cost of contagion in the true interbank network when counterparty exposures are unknown.</p>

<p align="LEFT">What is holding back infrastructure investment, even though real long-term interest rates are low and the potential supply of long-term finance is ample? The answer matters to policy makers, because infrastructure is a key determinant of the growth potential of an economy. This paper identifies some key obstacles for better and greater infrastructure finance and investment. One such obstacle is the lack of investable projects. Often, projects are not properly designed and contractual arrangements imply a distribution of risks and returns that create the wrong incentives among the various partners. The greater involvement of private investors and the design of economically rational financing structures can mitigate such problems. They also improve the efficiency and success of infrastructure projects. A pipeline of investable projects would allow large investors to commit a greater share of their financial resources to infrastructure. Tapping the vast resources of capital markets, which thus far have been underutilised, could significantly boost infrastructure finance. A greater variety of financial instruments for infrastructure finance would help to make infrastructure more attractive for a broader group of investors and would allow a better diversification of risks.</p>

This paper presents the "Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) Staff Underlying Inflation Gauge (UIG)" for CPI and PCE. Using a dynamic factor model approach, the UIG is derived from a broad data set that extends beyond price series to include a wide range of nominal, real, and financial variables. It also considers the specific and time-varying persistence of individual subcomponents of an inflation series. An attractive feature of the UIG is that it can be updated on a daily basis, which allows for a close monitoring of changes in underlying inflation. This capability can be very useful when large and sudden economic fluctuations occur, as at the end of 2008. In addition, the UIG displays greater forecast accuracy than traditional measures of core inflation.</p>

In this paper, we propose a new "shadow policy rate" for the US economy, using a large set of data representing the various facets of the US Federal Reserve's policy stance. Changes in term premia at various maturities and asset purchases by the Fed are key drivers of this shadow rate. We document that our shadow policy rate tracks the effective federal funds rate very closely before the recent crisis. More importantly, it provides a reasonable gauge of US monetary policy stance when the ZLB becomes binding. This facilitates the assessment of the policy stance against familiar Taylor rule benchmarks. Finally, we show that in structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models, the shadow policy rate helps identify monetary policy shocks that better reflect the Federal Reserve's unconventional policy measures.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The presence of "economic slack" directly implies that an economy can grow quickly without any necessary offsetting slow growth or retrenchment in the future. Based on this link between economic slack and future economic growth, I argue for a forecastbased estimate of the output gap as a measure of economic slack. This approach has the advantage of being robust to different assumptions about the underlying structure of the economy and allows for empirical analysis of a Phillips Curve relationship between the output gap and inflation. I apply this approach to investigate economic slack and its relationship with inflation for selected economies in Asia and the Pacific, taking into account structural breaks in long-run growth and uncertainty about the appropriate forecasting model.

<p align="LEFT">In this paper we examine how monetary policy should respond to nominal exchange rates in a New Keynesian open economy model that allows for a non-trivial role for sterilised intervention. The paper develops the argument against the backdrop of the evolving policy-making environment of Asian economies. Sterilised intervention can be a potent tool that offers policymakers an additional degree of freedom in maximising global welfare. We show that the gains to sterilised intervention are greater when goods market integration is low and exchange rate pass-through is high. However, increased financial internationalisation reduces the effectiveness of sterilised intervention, as the international policy trilemma becomes more relevant. Unsterilised intervention may also have a role to play, although the potential welfare gains from this are generally smaller.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most central banks in Asia have actively used sterilised foreign exchange intervention as a policy tool to smooth exchange rates. But, over time, declining exchange rate pass-through and the increasing international integration of financial and goods markets will tend to reduce the efficacy of sterilised intervention. Given the limited effectiveness of unsterilised intervention, our model implies that the role of exchange rate movements in the optimal setting of monetary policy in Asia is decreasing.</p>

<p align="left">We employ a threshold vector autoregression (TVAR) methodology in order to examine the nonlinear nature of the interactions among credit market conditions, monetary policy, and economic activity. We depart from the existing literature on the subject along two dimensions. First, we focus on a model in which the relevant threshold variable describes the state of economic activity rather than credit market conditions. Second, in contrast to the existing TVAR literature, which concentrates exclusively on single-threshold models, we allow for the presence of a second threshold, which is overwhelmingly supported by all relevant statistical tests. Our results indicate that the dynamics of the interactions among credit market conditions, monetary policy and economic activity change considerably as the economy moves from one phase of the business cycle to another and that single-threshold TVAR models are too restrictive to fully capture the nonlinear nature of those interactions. The impact of most shocks tends to be largest during periods of sub-par economic growth and smallest during times of moderate economic activity. By contrast, credit risk shocks have the largest impact when output growth is considerably above it long-term trend.</p>

<p>Monetary policies pursued in response to the financial crisis have shown that changes in central bank balance sheets have major macroeconomic consequences. The New Classical Macroeconomics, which gained increasing sway from the late-1980s, had led to an exclusive focus on the policy rate and a neglect of balance sheet effects. Key financial market imperfections that had been demonstrated by earlier (or contemporaneous) advances in microeconomic theory were assumed away under the guise of Ricardian equivalence. Getting their balance sheets back to normal levels is important in order to preserve policy flexibility for the future, but will present central banks with formidable challenges. This task will require cooperation with Treasuries without surrendering monetary policy independence.As central banks pragmatically monitor market resilience, the financial dominance trap is to be avoided.</p>

<p>Some observers argue that increased real integration has led to greater comovement of prices internationally. We examine the evidence for cross-border price spillovers among economies participating in the pan-Asian cross-border production networks. Starting with country-level data, we find that both producer price and consumer price inflation rates move more closely together between those Asian economies that trade more with one another, ie that share a higher degree of trade intensity. Next, using a novel data set based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), we examine the importance of the supply chain for cross-border price spillovers at the sectoral level. We document the increasing importance of imported intermediate inputs for economies in the Asia-Pacific region and examine the impact on domestic producer prices of changes in costs of imported intermediate inputs. Our results suggest that real integration through the supply chain matters for domestic price dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<p>This study presents evidence of the renminbi's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The CNH market - the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market in Hong Kong SAR - is found to exert an effect on Asian currencies that is distinct from that of the onshore (CNY) market. Changes in the RMB/USD rates in both markets have a statistically and economically significant impact on changes in Asian currency rates against the US dollar, even after controlling for other major currency moves and the transmission of China's monetary policy to the region. The continuing growth of the offshore renminbi market suggests that the influence of the CNH market is rising, but how long the independent impact will last will likely depend on China's progress in liberalising its capital account. The findings also suggest that China's regional influence is increasingly transmitted through financial channels.</p>

<p>Large-scale forex intervention in emerging market economies (EMEs) aimed at resisting currency appreciation has major implications for the composition of banking system balance sheets. The domestic monetary consequences depend on the nature of central bank liabilities that are the counterpart of forex reserves. Even if the immediate change in bank reserves due to FX intervention is offset by the sale of securities, bank lending may still be stimulated, running counter to the aims of the monetary authority. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of banks' holdings of liquid government securities, generated by such intervention, on bank credit in a panel of EMEs. We find that, for well capitalised banking systems, holdings of government and central bank paper over time lead to an expansion in their credit to the private sector. This result is confirmed at both country and bank level. The balance sheet effects of large-scale FX intervention therefore require close attention.</p>

<p>This paper analyses the discussion of a substitution account in the 1970s and how the account might have performed had it been agreed in 1980. The substitution account would have allowed central banks to diversify away from the dollar into the IMF's Special Drawing Right (SDR), comprised of US dollar, Deutsche mark, French franc (later euro), Japanese yen and British pound, through transactions conducted off the market. The account's dollar assets could fall short of the value of its SDR liabilities, and hedging would have defeated the purpose of preventing dollar sales. In the event, negotiators were unable to agree on how to distribute the open-ended cost of covering any shortfall if the dollar's depreciation were to exceed the value of any cumulative interest rate premium on the dollar. As it turned out, the substitution account would have encountered solvency problems had the US dollar return been based on US Treasury bill yields, even if a substantial fraction of the IMF's gold had been devoted to meet the shortfall at recent, high prices for gold. However, had the US dollar return been based on US Treasury bond yields, the substitution account would have been solvent even without any gold backing.</p>

<p>Bank capital ratios have increased steadily since the financial crisis. For a sample of 94 large banks from advanced and emerging economies, retained earnings account for the bulk of their higher risk-weighted capital ratios, with reductions in risk weights playing a lesser role. On average, banks continued to expand their lending, though lending growth was relatively slower among European banks. Lower dividend payouts and (for advanced economy banks) wider lending spreads have contributed to banks' ability to use retained earnings to build capital. Banks that came out of the crisis with higher capital ratios and stronger profitability were able to expand lending more.</p>

<p>A popular strategy for estimating output gaps is to anchor them to structural economic relationships. The resulting output gaps, however, are often highly sensitive to numerous auxiliary assumptions inherent in the approach. This complicates their use in policymaking. We illustrate the point using the Phillips curve, arguably the most popular structural relationship in this context. Depending on the specification, we show that conditioning on this relationship either introduces a trend in the output gap - which is conceptually unappealing - or has little effect on it - which defeats the purpose of the exercise. Moreover, the estimated gaps perform poorly in real time, with large ex-post revisions. The opaqueness of the approach, which increases greatly with the dimension of the estimated system, can mask these problems. In order to address these limitations, we propose a more parsimonious and transparent approach to embedding economic information that is less vulnerable to misspecification. As an illustration, we apply the corresponding parsimonious multivariate filter to US data. We find that proxies for the financial cycle, notably credit growth, but also unemployment contain significant information and help generate robust real-time output gap estimates.</p>

The low or negative term premium in the yield curve in the advanced economies from mid-2010 has pushed international investors into EM local bond markets: by lowering local long rates, this has considerably eased monetary conditions in the emerging markets. It has also encouraged much increased foreign currency borrowing in international bond markets by emerging market corporations, much of it by affiliates offshore. These developments strengthen the feedback effects between bond and foreign exchange markets. They also have significant implications for local banking systems.</p>

<p>If the criteria for an institution's success are diffusion and longevity, then central banking has been hugely successful. But if the criterion is the degree to which it has achieved its goals, then the evaluation has to be more nuanced. Historically, those goals have included a changing mix of financial and monetary stability. Attaining monetary and financial stability simultaneously has proved elusive across regimes. Edging closer towards that goal calls for incorporating systematically long-duration and disruptive financial booms and busts - financial cycles - in policy frameworks. For monetary policy, this means leaning more deliberately against booms and easing less aggressively and persistently during busts. What is ultimately at stake is the credibility of central banking - its ability to retain trust and legitimacy.</p>

<p>We study the effects of the new Basel III liquidity regulations in jurisdictions with a limited supply of high-quality liquid assets. Using a model based on Bech and Keister (2013), we show how introducing a liquidity coverage ratio in such settings can have significant side effects, leading to a large liquidity premium and pushing the short-term interest rate to the floor of the central bank's rate corridor. Adding a committed liquidity facility allows the central bank to mitigate these effects. By pricing committed liquidity appropriately, the central bank can determine either the equilibrium liquidity premium or the quantity of liquid assets held by banks, but not both. We argue that the optimal pricing arrangement will depend on local market conditions.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Standard measures of real economic co-movement between Asia-Pacific economies and those elsewhere had been observed to follow a downward trend, leading some commentators to suggest that the region was decoupling. However, this process reversed in response to the International Financial Crisis, and co-movement increased to historically high levels for some economies. We examine co-movement patterns and show that these are very sensitive to changes in macroeconomic volatility over time. Controlling for this, however, co-movement is closely linked to underlying trade and financial integration. If international links continue to strengthen in future, co-movement will strengthen in tandem. Decoupling is more a fiction than a fact or a forecast.</p>

<p>This paper examines two explanations for the recent spate of complaints about cross-border monetary policy spillovers and calls for international monetary policy coordination, a development that contrasts sharply with the monetary system in the 1980s, 1990s and until recently. The first explanation holds that deviations from rules-based policy at several central banks created incentives for other central banks to deviate from such policies. The second explanation either does not see deviations from rules or finds such deviations benign; it characterises recent unusual monetary policies as appropriate, explains the complaints as an adjustment to optimal policies, and downplays concerns about interest rate differentials and capital controls. Going forward, the goal for central banks should be an expanded rulesbased system similar to that of the 1980s and 1990s, which would operate near an international cooperative equilibrium. International monetary policy coordination - at least formal discussions of rules-based policies and the issues reviewed here - would help central banks get such equilibrium.</p>

Finally, I examine the ramifications for thinking about the impact on exchange rates and asset prices of emerging market economies.

<p>Following the experience of the global financial crisis, central banks have been asked to undertake unprecedented responsibilities. Governments and the public appear to have high expectations that monetary policy can provide solutions to problems that do not necessarily fit in the realm of traditional monetary policy. This paper examines three broad public policy goals that may overburden monetary policy: full employment, fiscal sustainability and financial stability. While central banks have a crucial position in public policy, the appropriate policy mix also involves other institutions, and overreliance on monetary policy to achieve these goals is bound to disappoint. Central bank policies that facilitate postponement of needed policy actions by governments may also have longer-term adverse consequences that could outweigh more immediate benefits. Overburdening monetary policy may eventually diminish and compromise the independence and credibility of the central bank, thereby reducing its effectiveness in maintaining price stability and contributing to crisis management.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the effect of cyclical macroeconomic policy and financial sector characteristics on growth. Using cross-country, cross-industry OECD data, it yields two main findings. First, countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies foster growth disproportionately in more credit/liquidity-constrained industries. Second, while higher bank capital ratios may contribute to reducing the benefit of a countercyclical monetary policy, countercyclical credit enhances growth disproportionately in more credit/liquidity-constrained industries and this complements the growth effects of countercyclical monetary policy. Raising regulatory requirements for bank capital can therefore help achieve financial stability and preserve economic growth if complemented with more countercyclical macroeconomic and regulatory policy.</p>

<p>In addition to revamping existing rules for bank capital, Basel III introduces a new global framework for liquidity regulation. One part of this framework is the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which requires banks to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a 30-day period of market stress. As monetary policy typically involves targeting the interest rate on loans of one of these assets - central bank reserves - it is important to understand how this regulation may impact the efficacy of central banks' current operational frameworks. We introduce term funding and an LCR requirement into an otherwise standard model of monetary policy implementation. Our model shows that if banks face the possibility of an LCR shortfall, then the usual link between open market operations and the overnight interest rate changes and the short end of the yield curve becomes steeper. Our results suggest that central banks may want to adjust their operational frameworks as the new regulation is implemented.</p>

<p>The adoption of a managed regime assumes that interventions are relatively successful. However, while some authors consider that foreign exchange interventions are not effective, arguing that domestic and foreign assets are close substitutes, others advocate their use and maintain that their effects can even last for months. There is also a lack of consensus on the related question of how to intervene. Are dirty interventions more powerful than pre-announced constant ones? This paper compares the effects of day-to-day interventions with discretionary interventions by combining a Tobit-GARCH reaction function with an asymmetric power PGARCH(1,1) impact function. Our results show that the impact of pre-announced and transparent US$ 20 million daily interventions, adopted by Colombia in 2008-2012, has been much larger than the impact of dirty interventions adopted in 2004-2007.We find that the impact of a change in daily interventions (from US$20 million to US$ 40 million) raises the exchange rate by approximately Col $2, implying that actual interventions of US$ 1000 million increase the exchange rate in one day by 5.50%. We also find a positive impact of capital controls.</p>

<p>This study presents indirect evidence of the effectiveness of sterilized interventions in Brazil based on the complete records of daily customer order flow data reported by Brazilian dealers, as well as foreign exchange intervention data over a time span of 10 years (2002-2011). We find that the effect of USD sales by end-users on the BRL/USD was much stronger on days in which the BCB did not intervene in the spot foreign exchange market. The regressions suggest that a 1% appreciation of the Real would have required the sale of 2.0 bn USD by final customers on days in which the Central Bank refrained from intervening. This compares to required sales of 5.5 bn USD on days in which the Central Bank was present in the market. This large effect, in spite of the fact that the median intervention amounted to only 140 mn USD, can be interpreted as evidence for the indirect damping channel. Furthermore, we find that order flows coming from outside of the financial sector have a (considerably) stronger effect on the BRL/USD exchange rate than those coming from financial customers. We argue that some studies may have failed to find significant effects of BCB interventions due to a problem of reverse causality, as in a regime of discretionary interventions the decision to intervene is often taken during trading hours.</p>

<p>We evaluate the response of perceived tail risks in financial markets to the implementation of unconventional monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Using information from out-of-money equity index options, we find that perceived risks decline significantly in response to both policy announcements and actual asset purchases. The announcement effects are strongest specifically for downside risk measures rather than simple measures of volatility (e.g. the VIX). The impact of actual purchases is strongest when driven by simultaneous expansion and the duration extension of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. These effects of both announcements and purchases have been variable over time and particularly pronounced during the latest policy phases implemented in 2012, a period also coinciding with the Federal Reserve's more extensive use of forward guidance about short-term rates.</p>

In the 2000s, domestic reforms in both countries expanded the effective labour force, restrained wages, shifted income towards profits and increased corporate saving.

<p>Since the 1980s, important and progressive reforms have profoundly reshaped the structure of the Chinese banking system. Many empirical studies suggest that financial reform promoted bank competition in most mature and emerging economies. However, some earlier studies that adopted conventional approaches to measure competition concluded that bank competition in China declined during the past decade, despite these reforms. In this paper, we show both empirically and theoretically that this apparent contradiction is the result of flawed measurement. Conventional indicators such as the Lerner index and Panzar-Rosse H-statistic fail to measure competition in Chinese loan markets properly due to the system of interest rate regulation. By contrast, the relatively new Profit Elasticity (PE) approach that was introduced in Boone (2008) as Relative Profit Differences (RPD) does not suffer from these shortcomings. Using balance sheet information for a large sample of banks operating in China during 1996-2008, we show that competition actually increased in the past decade when the PE indicator is used. We provide additional empirical evidence that supports our results. We find that these firstly are in line with the process of financial reform, as measured by several indices, and secondly are robust for a large number of alternative specifications and estimation methods. All in all, our analysis suggests that bank lending markets in China have been more competitive than previously assumed.</p>

<p>Early warning indicators (EWIs) of banking crises should ideally be evaluated on the basis of their performance relative to the macroprudential policy maker's decision problem. We translate several practical aspects of this problem - such as difficulties in assessing the costs and benefits of various policy measures as well as requirements for the timing and stability of EWIs - into statistical evaluation criteria. Applying the criteria to a set of potential EWIs, we find that the credit-to-GDP gap and a new indicator, the debt service ratio (DSR), consistently outperform other measures. The credit-to-GDP gap is the best indicator at longer horizons, whereas the DSR dominates at shorter horizons.</p>

<p>In the recent years several commentators hinted at an increase of the correlation between equity and commodity prices, and blamed investment in commodity-related products for this. First, this paper investigates such claims by looking at various measures of correlation. Next, we assess what are the implications of higher correlations between oil and equity prices for asset allocation. We develop a time-varying Bayesian Dynamic Conditional Correlation model for volatilities and correlations and find that joint modelling commodity and equity prices produces more accurate point and density forecasts, which lead to substantial benefits in portfolio allocation. This, however, comes at the price of higher portfolio volatility. Therefore, the popular view that commodities are to be included in one's portfolio as a hedging device is not grounded.</p>

<p>One area where international monetary cooperation has failed is in the role of surplus or creditor countries in limiting or in correcting external imbalances. The stock dimensions of such imbalances - net external positions, leverage in national balance sheets, currency/maturity mismatches, the structure of ownership of assets and liabilities and over-reliance on debt - can threaten financial stability in creditor as in debtor countries. Creditor countries therefore have a responsibility both for avoiding "overlending" and for devising cooperative solutions to excessive or prolonged imbalances.</p>

<p>The global financial crisis has reaffirmed the importance of financial factors for macroeconomic fluctuations. Recent work has shown how the conventional pre-crisis prescription that monetary policy should pay no attention to financial variables over and above their effects on inflation may no longer be valid in models that consider frictions in financial intermediation (Cúrdia and Woodford, 2009). This paper analyzes whether Taylor rules augmented with asset prices and credit can improve upon a standard rule in terms of macroeconomic stabilization in a DSGE with both a firms' <em>balance-sheet channel</em> and a <em>bank-lending channel</em> and in which the spread between lending and policy rates endogenously depends on banks' leverage. The main result is that, even in a model in which financial stability does not represent a distinctive policy objective, leaning-against-the-wind policies are desirable in the case of supply-side shocks whenever the central bank is concerned with output stabilization, while both strict inflation targeting and a standard rule are less effective. The gains are amplified if the economy is characterized by high private sector indebtedness.</p>

<p>We study how relationship lending and transaction lending vary over the business cycle. We develop a model in which relationship banks gather information on their borrowers, which allows them to provide loans for profitable firms during a crisis. Due to the services they provide, operating costs of relationship-banks are higher than those of transaction-banks. In our model, where relationship-banks compete with transaction-banks, a key result is that relationship-banks charge a higher intermediation spread in normal times, but offer continuation-lending at more favorable terms than transaction banks to profitable firms in a crisis. Using detailed credit register information for Italian banks before and after the Lehman Brothers' default, we are able to study how relationship and transaction-banks responded to the crisis and we test existing theories of relationship banking. Our empirical analysis confirms the basic prediction of the model that relationship banks charged a higher spread before the crisis, offered more favorable continuation-lending terms in response to the crisis, and suffered fewer defaults, thus confirming the informational advantage of relationship banking.</p>

<p>We find that declining bank credit to the private sector will not necessarily constrain the economic recovery after output has bottomed out following a financial crisis. To obtain this result, we examine data from 39 financial crises, which - as the current one - were preceded by credit booms. In these crises the change in bank credit, either in real terms or relative to GDP, consistently did not correlate with growth during the first two years of the recovery. In the third and fourth year, the correlation becomes statistically significant but remains small in economic terms. The lack of association between deleveraging and the speed of recovery does not seem to arise due to limited data. In fact, our data shows that increasing competitiveness, via exchange rate depreciations, is statistically and economically significantly associated with faster recoveries. Our results contradict the current consensus that private sector deleveraging is necessarily harmful for growth.</p>

<p>Federal Reserve purchases of bonds in recent years have meant that a smaller proportion of long-dated government debt has had to be held by other investors (private sector and foreign official institutions). But the US Treasury has been lengthening the maturity of its issuance at the same time. This paper reports estimates of the impact of these policies on long-term rates using an empirical model that builds on Laubach (2009). Lowering the average maturity of US Treasury debt held outside the Federal Reserve by one year is estimated to reduce the five-year forward 10-year yield by between 130 and 150 basis points. Such estimates assume that the decisions of debt managers are largely exogenous to cyclical interest rate developments; but they could be biased upwards if the issuance policies of debt managers are not exogenous but instead respond to interest rates. Central banks will face uncertainty not only about the true magnitude of maturity effects, but also about the size and concentration of interest rate risk exposures in the financial system. Nor do they know what the fiscal authorities and their debt managers will do as long-term rates change.</p>

<p>Using monthly data for four selected emerging economies, sterilised central bank foreign exchange intervention is found to have little systematic influence on the near-term nominal exchange rate expectations in the direction intended by the central banks. In other words, central bank dollar purchases to stem exchange rate appreciation or related exchange rate volatility are not associated with an adjustment of the near-term exchange rate forecasts in the direction of depreciation, and vice versa. This suggests intervention may not change the nearterm exchange rate expectations. Moreover, intervention may have had unintended effects in the sense that it can lead to undesired volatility in the exchange rate, which is consistent with previous studies.</p>

<p>The global financial crisis led to discussion of corrective bank taxes to promote financial stability. This paper interprets the widening of the FDIC assessment base from deposits to assets less equity for US-chartered banks in April 2011 as such a corrective or Pigovian tax. In terms of yields, banks shifted its cost to wholesale funders, benefiting floating-rate borrowers, while the linkage between onshore and offshore dollar money markets weakened. In terms of quantities, US-chartered banks shifted funding to more stable deposits. At the same time, the US branches of non-US banks, which were unaffected by the widened assessment base, increased US assets, funding their take-up of most of the Fed's reserve injection of $600 billion offshore. Thus, a new internationally uncoordinated policy had the expected effect on US banks' funding structure, but also redistributed dollar intermediation to non-US banks that continue to rely on wholesale funding. The implication for global financial stability is at best ambiguous.</p>

Generally, the measures show both economies becoming more financially open over time. In six of the eight dimensions, the Indian economy appears to be more open financially. Nevertheless, policy continues to segment onshore and offshore markets in both and policymakers face challenges in further financial integration.</p>

<p>Every financial crisis brings in its wake demands for more information; the latest one is no exception. Because, in deceptively tranquil times, it is well-nigh impossible to foster the consensus necessary to improve data availability, such a window of opportunity must not be missed. To be sure, the main reason why crises occur is not lack of statistics but the failure to interpret them correctly and to take remedial action. But better statistics can no doubt be a big help. Priorities for new data collections include better property prices and, above all, comprehensive financial information for banks on a consolidated and global basis, covering their balance sheets but also their income statements. This could be usefully complemented with corresponding information on the international geography of these banks' operations and, for crisis management purposes, with much more timely and granular data on their bilateral exposures. The collection of information should be based on sound governance arrangements, flexible and cost-efficient. The BIS can play and is playing a very active role.</p>

<p>A "stalling" economy has been defined as one that experiences a discrete deterioration in economic performance following a decline in its growth rate to below some threshold level. Previous efforts to identify stalls have focused primarily on the US economy, with the threshold level being chosen endogenously, and have suggested that the concept of a stall may be useful for macroeconomic forecasting.</p>
<p>We examine the international evidence for stalling in a panel of 51 economies using two different definitions of a stall threshold (time-invariant and related to lagged average growth rates) and two complementary empirical approaches (insample statistical significance and out-of-sample forecast performance). We find that the evidence for stalling based on time-invariant thresholds is limited: only 12 of the 51 economies in our sample experience statistically significant stalls, and including a stall threshold generally results in only modest improvements to out-ofsample forecast performance.

<p>We study the information in order flows in the world's largest over-the-counter market, the foreign exchange market. The analysis draws on a data set covering a broad cross-section of currencies and different customer segments of foreign exchange end-users.

We also find that different customer groups can share risk with each other effectively through the intermediation of a large dealer, and differ markedly in their predictive ability, trading styles, and risk exposure.</p>

<p>This paper argues that incorporating information about the financial cycle is important to improve measures of potential output and output gaps. Conceptually, identifying potential output with non-inflationary output is too restrictive. Potential output is seen as sustainable; yet experience indicates that output may be on an unsustainable path even if inflation is low and stable whenever financial imbalances are building up. More generally, as long as potential output is identified with the non-cyclical component of output fluctuations and financial factors play a key role in explaining the cyclical part, ignoring these factors leaves out valuable information. Within a simple and transparent framework, we show that including information about the financial cycle can yield measures of potential output and output gaps that are not only estimated more precisely, but also much more robust in real time. In the context of policy applications, such "finance-neutral" output gaps are shown to yield more reliable estimates of cyclically adjusted budget balances and to serve as complementary guides for monetary policy.</p>

<p>Large-scale central bank purchases of government bonds have made the long-term interest rate key in the monetary policy debate. How central banks react to bond market movements has varied greatly from one episode to another. Driving the term premium in long-term rates negative may stimulate aggregate demand. And a negative term premium encourages borrowers to lengthen the maturity of their debts. Such a reduction in maturity risks makes the financial system more resilient to shocks, and in particular can help emerging economies finance their heavy infrastructure and housing investment needs more safely. But an extended period of very low long rates and high public debt creates financial stability risks. Interest rate risk in the banking system has grown, and some institutional investors face significant exposures. Central banks in the advanced economies now hold a high proportion of bonds issued by their governments, most of which have so far failed to arrest the rise in the ratio of government debt to GDP. Implementing an effective exit strategy will be difficult. Current policy frameworks should be reconsidered, with a view to clarifying the importance of the long-term interest rate for monetary policy, for financial stability and for government debt management.</p>

<p>We explore the concept of global liquidity based on a factor model estimated using a large set of financial and macroeconomic variables from 24 advanced and emerging market economies. We measure global liquidity conditions based on the common global factors in the dynamics of liquidity indicators. By imposing theoretically motivated sign restrictions on factor loadings, we achieve a structural identification of the factors. The results suggest that global liquidity conditions are largely driven by three common factors and can therefore not be summarised by a single indicator. These three factors can be identified as global monetary policy, global credit supply and global credit demand.</p>

<p>Corporate bond issuers in emerging economies in Asia have often had a choice between an onshore market and an offshore one. Since 1998, however, many of these issuers have increasingly turned to the onshore market. This paper investigates systematically what factors have influenced this choice between markets for issuers in eight emerging economies - China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. For variables measuring market depth and liquidity, the availability of hedging instruments, and the size of the investor base, we rely on BIS statistics that have not been used in this literature before. We combine these market-level data with firm-level data in an unbalanced panel for the eight countries covering the period 1995 to 2007. We control for variables representing agency, static trade-off and risk management theories of the capital structure. Our results show that the choice between domestic and foreign markets has changed over time in large part because of the increased depth of the onshore market. The firms that benefit from such market development tend to be the unseasoned issuers rather than the seasoned ones.</p>

<p>This paper examines the relationship between low interests maintained by advanced economy central banks and credit booms in emerging economies. In a model with crossborder banking, low funding rates increase credit supply, but the initial shock is amplified through the "risk-taking channel" of monetary policy where greater risk-taking interacts with dampened measured risks that are driven by currency appreciation to create a feedback loop. In an empirical investigation using VAR analysis, we find that expectations of lower short-term rates dampen measured risks and stimulate cross-border banking sector capital flows.</p>

<p>Is systematic monetary policy a driver of the forward premium puzzle, i.e. the tendency of high interest-rate currencies to appreciate, thus strongly violating Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP)? We address this question by studying a battery of monetary policy rules in a small open economy that is subject to stationary but persistent domestic and foreign shocks. Each rule leads to model-implied UIP violations, which we derive analytically and then calibrate numerically. Our key finding is that only a forward-looking rule based on CPI inflation can account for frequently observed strong UIP violations.</p>

In the environment that has prevailed for at least three decades now, it is not possible to understand business fluctuations and the corresponding analytical and policy challenges without understanding the financial cycle.

This essay highlights the stylised empirical features of the financial cycle, conjectures as to what it may take to model it satisfactorily, and considers its policy implications. In the discussion of policy, the essay pays special attention to the bust phase, which is less well explored and raises much more controversial issues.</p>

Our main results are that major natural catastrophes have large and significant negative effects on economic activity, both on impact and over the longer run. However, it is mainly the uninsured losses that drive the subsequent macroeconomic cost, whereas sufficiently insured events are inconsequential in terms of foregone output. This result helps to disentangle conflicting findings in the literature, and puts the focus on risk transfer mechanisms to help mitigate the macroeconomic costs of natural catastrophes.</p>

<p>The increase in the TARGET2 balance for the Bundesbank has led to a debate in Germany about the appropriate interpretation and policy response, if any. In this paper we review the evidence for the current account financing interpretation, and find it wanting in explaining the data in 2012. BIS international banking data, by contrast, point to the importance of TARGET2 balances as a symptom of a reduction by core European banks of credit previously extended to borrowers in peripheral Europe. These same data suggest that banks headquartered outside the euro area, particularly UK banks, boosted TARGET2 balances by hedging redenomination risk. As such, TARGET2 balances reflect not only concern regarding actual credit exposures but also potential currency exposures.</p>

The analysis focuses on wholesale trading in the two markets and is based on a complete transaction level dataset covering November 2007 until end 2011. Overall, our findings suggest that Danish benchmark covered bonds by and large are as liquid as Danish government bonds - including in periods of market stress. Before the financial crisis of 2008, government bonds were slightly more liquid than covered bonds. During the crisis, trading continued in both markets but the government bond market experienced a brief but pronounced decline in market liquidity while liquidity in the covered bond market was more robust - partly reflective of a number of events as well as policy measures introduced in the autumn of 2008. After the crisis, liquidity in the government bond market quickly rebounded and government bonds again became slightly more liquid than covered bonds.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, cross-border inflows into emerging market (EM) local currency bonds have surged. The returns on these bonds have moved more closely with those on international assets regarded as "safe", particularly following the euro area debt crisis. This paper first demonstrates that domestic factors have tended to dictate the dynamics of the EM local currency government yield. The importance of local drivers has probably increased the potential diversification benefit, creating strong appetite for the asset class. Second, the paper confirms that EM local currency government yields have behaved more like safe haven yields since 2008: they have dropped, rather than increased, in response to worsening global risk sentiment. Yet EM local currency government yields could be susceptible to adverse external shocks: the yield dynamics have been affected by unsustainably low US Treasury yields. Moreover, the international role of EM local currency bonds depends crucially on the behaviour of exchange rates. Nevertheless, the further development of local currency bond markets should help strengthen the stability of the international monetary and financial system.</p>

<p>Accommodative monetary policy during the financial crisis was instrumental in preventing a deeper recession. Views differ, however, on how long such measures should be kept in place. At the heart of this debate is the notion that a protracted period of policy accommodation could create distortions. Some would argue that any distortions will be limited in extent and that further monetary stimuli should bolster the recovery. Others fear that prolonged easing may delay much-needed balance sheet adjustments, thus entrenching weak economic performance. Our analysis, based on a sample of 24 developed countries, indicates that monetary policy is less effective in a financial crisis, when impairments in the monetary transmission mechanism may occur. In particular, the results show that the benefits of accommodative monetary policy during a downturn for the subsequent recovery are more elusive when the downturn is associated with a financial crisis. In addition, we find that private sector deleveraging during a downturn helps to induce a stronger recovery. Both results hold even after controlling for the fiscal policy stance, real exchange rate movements and developments in the international environment. That said, the evidence is tentative owing to the restricted size and other limitations of our sample.</p>

Existing work contends that, when individual players have an incentive to coordinate their actions, public policy signals could steer these actions away from the fundamentals. We argue that such a conclusion rests on a restricted information structure, predicated on markets being segmented. Public policy signals are unambiguously beneficial in an integrated market, where they refine other public information that prices generate endogenously. An implication of this finding is that policy authorities have an important role to play in collecting and disseminating data on aggregate market positions.</p>

<p>When the baby boomers joined the workforce and started saving, money supply and property prices entered a rising trajectory. We conclude that demography was the long-run driver of this process, basing our argument on data from 22 advanced economies for the 1950-2010 period. According to our lifecycle model, large working-age populations saved for their old age by investing in property and broad money instruments, such as deposits. In the past, savings activity by baby boomers drove up property prices and also increased demand for money. As baby boomers retire, these dynamics will go into reverse. Falling demand for savings, including money and deposits, might hinder banks in their efforts to collect deposits and thereby bring down excessively high loan-to-deposit ratios. Our model also confirms that monetary stability contributes to long-run property price stability.</p>

It finds that an exogenous increase in central bank balance sheets at the zero lower bound leads to a temporary rise in economic activity and consumer prices. The estimated output effects turn out to be qualitatively similar to the ones found in the literature on the effects of conventional monetary policy, while the impact on the price level is weaker and less persistent. Individual country results suggest that there are no major differences in the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policies across countries, despite the heterogeneity of the measures that were taken.</p>

To answer this question, in this paper the balance sheets and syndicated loan portfolios of 87 large internationally active banks, approximately half of which were rescued during the crisis, are analysed for the period 2000-10. Evidence is presented that banks that were later rescued took on higher risk in their loan books before the crisis than banks that were not, especially in their home markets. Although the riskiness of loan signings started diminishing across the board in 2009, we do not find consistent evidence that rescued banks reduced their risk relatively more than non rescued banks during the crisis.</p>

<p>This paper describes the international flow of funds associated with calm and volatile global equity markets. During calm periods, portfolio investment by real money and leveraged investors in advanced countries flows into emerging markets. When central banks in the receiving countries resist exchange rate appreciation and buy dollars against domestic currency, they end up investing in medium-term bonds in reserve currencies. In the process they fund themselves (or "sterilise" the expansion of local bank reserves) by issuing safe assets in domestic currency to domestic investors. Thus, calm periods, marked by leveraged investing in emerging markets, lead to an asymmetric asset swap (risky emerging market assets against safe reserve currency assets) and leveraging up by emerging market central banks. In declining and volatile global equity markets, these flows reverse, and, contrary to some claims, emerging market central banks draw down reserves substantially. In effect emerging market central banks then release safe assets from their reserves, supplying safe havens to global investors.</p>

<p>We characterise empirically the financial cycle using two approaches: analysis of turning points and frequency-based filters. We identify the financial cycle with the medium-term component in the joint fluctuations of credit and property prices; equity prices do not fit this picture well. We show that financial cycle peaks are very closely associated with financial crises and that the length and amplitude of the financial cycle have increased markedly since the mid-1980s. We argue that this reflects, in particular, financial liberalisation and changes in monetary policy frameworks. So defined, the financial cycle is much longer than the traditional business cycle. Business cycle recessions are much deeper when they coincide with the contraction phase of the financial cycle. We also draw attention to the "unfinished recession" phenomenon: policy responses that fail to take into account the length of the financial cycle may help contain recessions in the short run but at the expense of larger recessions down the road.</p>

<p>Prudential instruments are commonly seen as the tools that can be used to deliver the macroprudential policy goals of reducing the frequency and severity of financial crises. And interest rates are traditionally viewed as the means to deliver the macroeconomic stabilisation goals of low, stable inflation and sustainable, stable growth. But, at the macroeconomic level, these two sets of policy tools have quite a bit in common. We use a simple macroeconomic model to study the extent to which capital adequacy requirements and interest rates might be substitutes in meeting the objective of stabilising the economy. We find that in our model both are substitutes for achieving conventional monetary policy objectives. In addition, we show that, in principle, they can both be used to meet financial stability objectives. This implies a need to coordinate the use of macroprudential and traditional monetary policy tools, a need that has clear implications for the construction of the policy framework designed to deliver the joint objectives of macroeconomic and financial stability.</p>

<p>Very low interest rates in major currencies have raised concerns over international credit flows to robustly growing economies in Asia. This paper examines three components of international credit and highlights several of the policy challenges that arise in constraining such credit. Our empirical findings suggest that international credit enables domestic credit booms in emerging markets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher levels of international credit on the eve of a crisis are associated with larger subsequent contractions in overall credit and real output. In Asia today, international credit generally is small in relation to overall credit - as was not the case before the Asian crisis. So even though dollar credit is growing very rapidly in some Asian economies, its contribution to overall credit growth has been modest outside the more dollarised economies of Asia.</p>

<p>The recent financial crisis has shown how interconnected the financial world has become. Shocks in one location or asset class can have a sizable impact on the stability of institutions and markets around the world. But systemic risk analysis is severely hampered by the lack of consistent data that capture the international dimensions of finance. While currently available data can be used more effectively, supervisors and other agencies need more and better data to construct even rudimentary measures of risks in the international financial system. Similarly, market participants need better information on aggregate positions and linkages to appropriately monitor and price risks.

<p>In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, many regimes in Asia adopted stricter provisioning requirements, as well as discretionary measures, with the objective of increasing provisioning in good times in response to rising levels of risk. Based on a final sample of 240 banks in 12 Asian economies, the evidence is that countercyclical loan loss provisioning has dominated throughout emerging Asia, most strikingly so in the case of India. Thus, loan loss provisioning did not simply become more conservative at all points in time subsequent to the Asian financial crisis, but actively leaned in a fashion that ameliorated swings in earnings and the macroeconomy.</p>

<p>We investigate if asset return volatility is predictable by macroeconomic and financial variables and shed light on the economic drivers of financial volatility. Our approach is distinct due to its comprehensiveness: First, we employ a data-rich forecast methodology to handle a large set of potential predictors in a Bayesian Model Averaging approach, and, second, we take a look at multiple asset classes (equities, foreign exchange, bonds, and commodities) over long time spans. We find that proxies for credit risk and funding (il)liquidity consistently show up as common predictors of volatility across asset classes. Variables capturing time-varying risk premia also perform well as predictors of volatility. While forecasts by macro-finance augmented models also achieve forecasting gains out-of-sample relative to autoregressive benchmarks, the performance varies across asset classes and over time.</p>

<p>By the end of 2012, all standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives must be cleared with central counterparties (CCPs). In this paper, we estimate the amount of collateral that CCPs should demand to clear safely all interest rate swap and credit default swap positions of the major derivatives dealers. Our estimates are based on potential losses on a set of hypothetical dealer portfolios that replicate several aspects of the way that derivatives positions are distributed within and across dealer portfolios in practice. Our results suggest that major dealers already have sufficient unencumbered assets to meet initial margin requirements, but that some of them may need to increase their cash holdings to meet variation margin calls. We also find that default funds worth only a small fraction of dealers' equity appear sufficient to protect CCPs against almost all possible losses that could arise from the default of one or more dealers, especially if initial margin requirements take into account the tail risks and time variation in risk of cleared portfolios. Finally, we find that concentrating clearing of OTC derivatives in a single CCP could economise on collateral requirements without undermining the robustness of central clearing.</p>

<p>In this paper we analyse the effects of informal labour markets on the dynamics of inflation and on the transmission of aggregate demand and supply shocks. In doing so, we incorporate the informal sector in a modified New Keynesian model with labour market frictions as in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model. Our main results show that the informal economy generates a "buffer" effect that diminishes the pressure of demand shocks on inflation. This finding is consistent with the empirical literature on the effects of informal labour markets in business cycle fluctuations. This result implies that, in economies with large informal labour markets, changes in interest rates are more effective in stimulating real output and there is less impact on inflation. Furthermore, the model produces cyclical flows from informal to formal employment, consistent with the data.</p>

<p>We estimate a structural model of herding behavior in which feedback arises due to mutual concerns of traders over the unobservable "true" level of market liquidity. In a herding regime, random shocks are exacerbated by endogenous feedback, producing a dampened power-law in the fluctuation of largest sales. The key to the fluctuation is that each trader responds not only to private information, but also to the aggregate behavior of others. Applying the model to the data on portfolios of institutional investors (fund managers), we find that the empirical distribution is consistent with model predictions. A stock's realized illiquidity propagates herding and raises the probability of observing a sell-off. The distribution function itself has desirable properties for evaluating "tail risk".</p>

<p>The financial systems in emerging market economies (EMEs) during the 2008-09 global financial crisis performed much better than in previous crisis episodes, albeit with significant differences across regions. For example, real credit growth in Asia and Latin America was less affected than in Central and Eastern Europe. This paper identifies the factors at both the country and the bank levels that contributed to the behaviour of real credit growth in Latin America during the global financial crisis. The resilience of real credit during the crisis was highly related to policies, measures and reforms implemented in the pre-crisis period.</p>
<p>In particular, we find that the best explanatory variables were those that gauged the economy's capacity to withstand an external financial shock. Key were balance sheet measures such as the economy's overall currency mismatches and external debt ratios (measuring either total debt or short-term debt). The quality of pre-crisis credit growth mattered as much as its rate of expansion. Credit expansions that preserved healthy balance sheet measures (the "quality" dimension) proved to be more sustainable. Variables signalling the capacity to set countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies during the crisis were also important determinants. Moreover, financial soundness characteristics of Latin American banks, such as capitalisation, liquidity and bank efficiency, also played a role in explaining the dynamics of real credit during the crisis. We also found that foreign banks and banks which had expanded credit growth more before the crisis were also those that cut credit most.</p>
<p>The methodology used in this paper includes the construction of indicators of resilience of real credit growth to adverse external shocks in a large number of emerging markets, not just in Latin America. As additional data become available, these indicators could be part of a set of analytical tools to assess how emerging market economies are preparing themselves to cope with the adverse effects of global financial turbulence on real credit growth.</p>

By contrast, as long as properly designed, stress tests can be quite effective as crisis management and resolution tools. We also see additional side benefits, stemming largely from the way such tests can discipline thinking about financial stability. We suggest possible ways to improve their performance.</p>

<p>Poor financial market returns and low long-term real interest rates in recent years have created challenges for the sponsors of defined benefit pension schemes. At the same time, lower payroll tax revenues in a period of high unemployment, and rising fiscal deficits in many advanced economies as economic activity has fallen, are also testing the sustainability of pay-as-you-go public pension schemes. Amendments to pension accounting rules that require corporations to regularly report the valuation differences between their defined benefit pension assets and plan liabilities on their balance sheet have made investors more aware of the pension risk exposure for the sponsors of such schemes. This paper sheds light on what effects these developments are having on the design of occupational pension schemes, and also provides some estimates for the post-employment benefits that could be delivered by these schemes under different sets of assumptions. The paper concludes by providing some policy perspectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Few financial variables are more fundamental than the "risk free" real long-term interest rate because it prices the terms of exchange over time. During the past 15 years, it has dropped from a range of 4 to 5% to a range of 0 to 2%. By late 2011, cyclical factors had driven it close to zero. This paper explores why. Possible persistent factors are: the investment of the large savings generated by developing Asia in highly-rated bonds; accounting and valuation rules for institutional investment; and financial sector regulation. The consequences could be far-reaching: cheaper leverage; less pressure to correct fiscal deficits; larger interest rate exposures in the financial industry; and a more cyclical bond market. During the financial crisis, central banks in the advanced countries have made the long-term interest rate a policy variable as Keynes had always advocated. This policy focus will draw more attention to the macroeconomic and financial consequences of government debt management policies. Coordination between central bank balance sheet policies and government debt management is essential. With government debt very high for years to come, bond market volatility could confront central banks with unenviable choices.</p>

This spread in excess returns is not explained by traditional risk factors, it is partially explained by transaction costs and shows behavior consistent with investor under- and over-reaction. Moreover, crosssectional currency momentum has very different properties from the widely studied carry trade and is not highly correlated with returns of benchmark technical trading rules. However, there seem to be very effective limits to arbitrage which prevent momentum returns from being easily exploitable in currency markets.</p>

<p>According to standard economic theory, fiscal policy should be countercyclical. In the neoclassical smoothing model of Barro (1979), a government should optimally run surpluses in good times and deficits in bad times. That is the same a government should do, though for different reasons, in the standard Keynesian or neo-Keynesian framework.</p>
<p>Yet in practice governments often seem to follow a pro-cyclical fiscal policy. Cuddington (1989), Talvi and Vegh (2005) and Sinnott (2009), among others, document that governments save little or even disave in booms. Procyclicality is most evident in Latin America (Gavin et al (1996), Gavin and Perotti (1997), Stein et al (1999)) but is also present in OECD countries (Talvi and Vegh (2005), Arreaza et al (1999), Lane (2003)).</p>

<p>The Great Recession and worldwide financial crisis have exploded fiscal imbalances and brought fiscal policy and inflation to the forefront of policy concerns. Those concerns will only grow as aging populations increase demands on government expenditures in coming decades. It is widely perceived that fiscal policy is inflationary if and only if it leads the central bank to print new currency to monetize deficits. Monetization can be inflationary. But it is a misperception that this is the only channel for fiscal inflations. Nominal bonds, the predominant form of government debt in advanced economies, derive their value from expected future nominal primary surpluses and money creation; changes in the price level can align the market value of debt to its expected real backing. This introduces a fresh channel, not requiring monetization, through which fiscal deficits directly affect inflation. The paper begins by pointing out similarities and differences between the Weimar Republic after World War I and the United States today. It describes various ways in which fiscal policy can directly affect inflation and explains why these fiscal effects are difficult to detect in time series data.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Historically, periods of high indebtedness have been associated with a rising incidence of default or restructuring of public and private debts. A subtle type of debt restructuring takes the form of "financial repression." Financial repression includes directed lending to government by captive domestic audiences (such as pension funds), explicit or implicit caps on interest rates, regulation of cross-border capital movements, and (generally) a tighter connection between government and banks. In the heavily regulated financial markets of the Bretton Woods system, several restrictions facilitated a sharp and rapid reduction in public debt/GDP ratios from the late 1940s to the 1970s. Low nominal interest rates help reduce debt servicing costs while a high incidence of negative real interest rates liquidates or erodes the real value of government debt. Thus, financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied by a steady dose of inflation. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in effect, it need not be very high (by historic standards). For the advanced economies in our sample, real interest rates were negative roughly ½ of the time during 1945-1980. For the United States and the United Kingdom our estimates of the annual liquidation of debt via negative real interest rates amounted on average from 2 to 3 percent of GDP a year. We describe some of the regulatory measures and policy actions that characterized the heyday of the financial repression era.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>As governments around the world contemplate slashing budget deficits, the "expansionary fiscal consolidation hypothesis" is back in vogue. I argue that, as a statement about the short run, it should be taken with caution.</p>
<p>Alesina and Perotti (1995) and Alesina and Ardagna (2010) (AAP) have argued that fiscal consolidations may be expansionary if implemented mainly by cutting government spending. IMF (2010) criticizes the data and methodology used by AAP, and reach opposite conclusions. Some of the methodological critiques are correct. However, the implementation of the IMF methodology has several problems of its own. I then argue that because of the multi-year nature of the large fiscal consolidations, which are precisely the most informative ones, using yearly panels of fiscal policy is limiting. I present four detailed case studies, two - Denmark and Ireland - undertaken under fixed exchange rates (the most relevant case for many Eurozone countries today) and two - Finland and Sweden - after floating the currency.</p>
<p>All four fiscal episodes were associated with an expansion; but only in Denmark the driver of growth was internal demand. However, after three years a long slump set in as the economy lost competitiveness. In all the others for a long time the main driver of growth was exports. In Ireland this occurred because the sterling coincidentally appreciated. In Finland and Sweden the currency experienced an extremely large depreciation after floating.</p>
<p>In all consolidations interest rate fell fast, and wage moderation played a key role in generating a gain competitiveness and a decline in interest rates. Wage moderation was facilitated by the direct intervention of the government in the wage negotiation process. In Finland and Sweden, the adoption of inflation targeting at the same time of the consolidation helped the decline in interest rates.</p>
<p>These results cast doubt on at least some versions of the "expansionary fiscal consolidations" hypothesis, and on its applicability to many countries in the present circumstances. A depreciation is not available to EMU members today (except vis à vis countries outside the Eurozone). A net export boom is not feasible for the world as a whole. A further decline in interest rates is unlikely in the current situation. And incomes policies are not popular nowadays; moreover, international experience, and the Danish case, suggest that they are ineffective after a few years.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>As the world economy slowly recovers from the very deep and widespread recession of recent years, many countries confront very serious fiscal imbalances. How much time they have to deal with these imbalances is a central question, the salience of which can only have been increased by the ongoing fiscal crisis and bailout in Greece and the immediate fiscal adjustments being discussed or already undertaken in several other countries.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that much of the current attention to fiscal imbalances is attributable to the rapid increases in debt to GDP ratios arising from the recession, either directly through the automatic tax and spending responses to slow growth, or indirectly through the countercyclical discretionary fiscal measures undertaken. Table 1 shows the evolution of net general government debt to GDP ratios for several leading economies in recent years, starting in 2007, just as the worldwide recession began.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper examines the evolving role of reserve requirements as a policy tool in China. Since 2007, the Chinese central bank (PBC) has relied more on this tool to withdraw domestic liquidity surpluses, as a cheaper substitute for open-market operation instruments in this period of rapid FX accumulation. China's reserve requirement system has also become more complex and been used to address a range of other policy objectives, not least being macroeconomic management, financial stability and credit policy. The preference for using reserve requirements reflects the size of China's FX sterilisation task and the associated cost considerations, a quantity-oriented monetary policy framework challenged to reconcile policy dilemmas and tactical considerations. The PBC often finds it easier to reach consensus over reserve requirement decisions than interest rate decisions and enjoys greater discretion in applying this tool. The monetary effects of reserve requirements need to be explored in conjunction with other policy actions and not in isolation. Depending on the policy mix, higher reserve requirements tend to signal a tightening bias, to squeeze excess reserves of banks, to push market interest rates higher, and to help widen net interest spreads, thus tightening domestic monetary conditions. There are, however, costs to using this policy tool, as it imposes a tax burden on Chinese banks that in turn appear to have passed a significant portion of this cost onto their customers, mostly depositors and SMEs. However, the pass-through onto bank customers appears to be partial.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>A substantial literature has investigated the role of relationship lending in shielding borrowers from idiosyncratic shocks. Much less is known about how lending relationships and bank-specific characteristics affect the functioning of the credit market in an economy-wide crisis, when banks may find it difficult to perform the role of shock absorbers. We investigate how bank-specific characteristics (size, liquidity, capitalization, funding structure) and the bank-firm relationship have influenced interest rate setting since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Unlike the existing literature, which has focused chiefly on the amount of credit granted during the crisis, we look at its cost. The data on a large sample of loans from Italian banks to non-financial firms suggest that close lending relationships kept firms more insulated from the financial crisis. Further, spreads increased by less for the customers of well-capitalized, liquid banks and those engaged mainly in traditional lending business.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The existing literature on estimated structural News Driven Business Cycle (NDBC) models has focused almost exclusively on macroeconomic data and has largely ignored asset prices. In this paper, we present evidence that including data on asset prices in the estimation of a structural NDBC model dramatically affects inference about the main sources of business cycle fluctuations. Combined with the large body of evidence that asset price movements reflect changes in expectations of future developments in the economy, our results imply that data on asset prices should always be used in the estimation of structural NDBC models because they contain information that cannot be obtained by using solely macroeconomic data.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper examines whether the rescue measures adopted during the global financial crisis helped to sustain the supply of bank lending. The analysis proposes a setup that allows testing for structural shifts in the bank lending equation, and employs a novel dataset covering large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1995-2010. While stronger capitalisation sustains loan growth in normal times, banks during a crisis can turn additional capital into greater lending only once their capitalisation exceeds a critical threshold. This suggests that recapitalisations may not translate into greater credit supply until bank balance sheets are sufficiently strengthened.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The international financial crisis of the late 2000s has revived interest in asset price bubble research. For some, the event confirmed the enduring relevance of studying asset price bubbles in our economies. For others, it was a realisation that asset price bubbles are of much greater significance than previously thought.</p>
<p>The financial and policy preconditions that foster "frothy" asset prices which characterise bubbles have been the focus of considerable attention. While doubtless important, it is not the only aspect that requires greater understanding. We also need to develop a better understanding of the whole life-cycle of asset price bubbles, from their origins, to their expansion and spread, the inevitable collapse, and the aftermath that has to be cleaned up. It is increasingly recognised that researchers must not treat bubbles as one-off, exogenous events. The challenge is to develop a more holistic approach, and then build into our policy models endogenous bubble behavior. Such behavior may indeed be rare but nonetheless has its origins in a number of avoidable factors, not least being some combination of financial fragility, flawed policy frameworks, and poor risk management decisions.</p>
<p>This paper contributes to our understanding of asset price bubbles by looking at assets when they are severely underpriced, ie when there are negative asset price bubbles. Generally, negative asset price bubbles are an underrepresented protagonist in most crisis stories, and this has certainly been the case in the recent international financial crisis. The particular illustration for this paper comes from an examination of the financial market spillovers from the West to Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Where did the spillovers come from and how will the crisis end? While there are many different ways to conceptualise the spillovers, this paper will show how cross-border spillovers led to the severe underpricing of various types of assets in Asia and the Pacific. And, just as the policy response to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the United States may have contributed to the housing problems in the 2000s, there are concerns that accommodative monetary policy in response to the negative asset price bubble and associated macroeconomic fallout may be laying the foundation for a round of positive asset price bubbles.</p>
<p>The paper begins with a brief discussion of a negative asset price bubble and a narrative of the international financial crisis in Asia and the Pacific. Prior to September 2008, the international financial crisis had had a limited impact on Asia-Pacific markets. To be sure there were periods of unusual stress but, by and large, the region was more focused on macroeconomic policy issues throughout much of the year. That all changed in late 2008 as the region, despite its strong economic and financial fundamentals, entered what was to become a sharp V-shaped business cycle. Through the lens of a negative asset price bubble perspective, this paper helps to shed new light on the unusual dynamics as well as the policy trade-offs faced during the crisis and afterward. Asia and the Pacific economies are particularly useful "laboratories" to examine these phenomena because of the diverse economic, financial, and policy frameworks in place.</p>
<p>The paper also presents a simple model of endogenous asset price bubbles to clarify some of the policy issues. The model assumes there are two regions of the world that are susceptible to domestic asset price bubbles. This type of model emphasises the highly persistent nature of financial shocks associated with boom-bust dynamics and the potential spillovers across geographic borders. An asset price bubble in one economy can influence the likelihood of an asset price bubble in the other economy. Possibly most important, the actions of the policymaker in one region can affect not only the occurrence of a bubble in its domestic market but also the occurrence of a bubble in the other region. This type of model also elevates the importance of tail risk considerations for policymakers, opening up consideration of more complex monetary policy trade-offs than in conventional macroeconomic models.</p>
<p>The paper then explores the implications, combining both the narrative from the crisis and the implications of the theoretical model to understand better the regional policy trade-offs that occurred during the international financial crisis. In addition to emphasising the critical importance of having strong economic and financial fundamentals going into a crisis period, it also highlights the value of monetary policymakers adopting state-dependent policy frameworks. During normal times, monetary policy focused on price stability makes sense. During crisis times, the priorities of a central bank may need to be adjusted by putting more weight on financial stability than on short-term inflation stability. This comes down to placing more weight on tail risks when making policy decisions. Practically, this means that short-term deviations from (implicit and explicit) inflation targets may be appropriate, if not optimal, when coming out of a crisis.</p>
<p>The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out the basic intuition of a negative asset price bubble. Section 3 reviews the Asia-Pacific experience during the recent international financial crisis, highlighting aspects of this new bubble perspective. Section 4 then presents a simple international monetary policy model with negative asset price bubbles to explore the theoretical channels of spillovers and the policy trade-offs. Section 5 describes results. Section 6 draws on the historical narrative and theoretical findings to evaluate the policy implications. Section 7 offers some conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We investigate the performance of different variables as anchors for setting the level of the countercyclical regulatory capital buffer requirements for banks. The gap between the ratio of credit-to-GDP and its long-term backward-looking trend performs best as an indicator for the accumulation of capital as this variable captures the build-up of system-wide vulnerabilities that typically lead to banking crises. Other indicators, such as credit spreads, are better in indicating the release phase as they are contemporaneous signals of banking sector distress that can precede a credit crunch.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The recent financial crisis has triggered a major rethink of analytical approaches and policy towards financial stability. The crisis has encouraged a sharper focus on systemic risk, the inclusion of a financial sector in macroeconomic models, a shift from a microprudential to a macroprudential orientation in regulation and supervision, and questions about whether price stability is a sufficient criterion to guide monetary policy. In the process, it has led to a rediscovery of the macroeconomic roots of financial instability. This paper argues that this development is welcome but has not gone far enough. To substantiate this conclusion, the paper documents this analytical and policy journey before suggesting a way forward.</p>

Central banks face a threefold challenge: economic, intellectual and institutional. This essay puts forward a compass to help central banks sail in the largely uncharted waters ahead. The compass is based on tighter integration of the monetary and financial stability functions, keener awareness of the global dimensions of those tasks, and stronger safeguards for an increasingly vulnerable central bank operational independence.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>At moderate levels, debt improves welfare and enhances growth. But high levels can be damaging. When does debt go from good to bad? We address this question using a new dataset that includes the level of government, non-financial corporate and household debt in 18 OECD countries from 1980 to 2010. Our results support the view that, beyond a certain level, debt is a drag on growth. For government debt, the threshold is around 85% of GDP. The immediate implication is that countries with high debt must act quickly and decisively to address their fiscal problems. The longer-term lesson is that, to build the fiscal buffer required to address extraordinary events, governments should keep debt well below the estimated thresholds. Our examination of other types of debt yields similar conclusions. When corporate debt goes beyond 90% of GDP, it becomes a drag on growth. And for household debt, we report a threshold around 85% of GDP, although the impact is very imprecisely estimated.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The macroeconomic performance of individual countries varied markedly during the 2007-09 global financial crisis. While China's growth never dipped below 6% and Australia's worst quarter was no growth, the economies of Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom suffered annualised GDP contractions of 5-10% per quarter for five to seven quarters in a row. We exploit this cross-country variation to examine whether a country's macroeconomic performance over this period was the result of pre-crisis policy decisions or just good luck. The answer is a bit of both. Better-performing economies featured a better-capitalised banking sector, lower loan-to-deposit ratios, a current account surplus, high foreign exchange reserves and low levels and growth rates of private sector credit-to-GDP. In other words, sound policy decisions and institutions reduced their vulnerability to the financial crisis. But these economies also featured a low level of financial openness and less exposure to US creditors, suggesting that good luck played a part.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The unique structure of syndicated lending results in information asymmetries within the lending syndicate between banks of varying degrees of seniority. While previous studies have attempted to use indirect proxy measures to capture the effects of such information asymmetries, in this paper we propose a more direct measure. This offers new insights into how junior and senior banks rely on their own and each other's information sets in lending syndicates. In particular, we look at the previous number of borrowing/lending relationships between individual borrowers and lenders and the duration of these interactions. Using this new, direct and explicit measure on a sample of 5,842 syndicated loan transactions between 1993 and 2006, we find that when participant banks have information inferiority in the syndicate they require higher loan spreads to compensate for this asymmetry. This is amplified when the borrowers are more opaque. We thus show how junior participant banks with repeat relationships with the same borrower graduate from uniformed to informed lenders (the spread goes down as asymmetry diminishes) and how they rely both on the arranger's reputation and their own repeat experience with the borrower.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We provide new insights on the formation of inflation expectations - in particular at a time of great financial and economic turmoil - by evaluating results from a survey conducted from July 2009 through July 2010. Participants in this survey answered a weekly questionnaire about their short-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations. Participants received common information sets with data relevant to euro area inflation. Our analysis of survey responses reveals several interesting results. First, our evidence is consistent with long-term expectations having remained well anchored to the ECB's definition of price stability, which acted as a focal point for long-term expectations. Second, the turmoil in euro area bond markets triggered by the Greek fiscal crisis influenced short- and medium-term inflation expectations but had only a very small impact on long-term expectations. By contrast, longterm expectations did not react to developments of the euro area wide fiscal burden. Third, participants changed their expectations fairly frequently. The longer the horizon, the less frequent but larger these changes were. Fourth, expectations exhibit a large degree of timevariant non-normality. Fifth, inflation expectations appear fairly homogenous across groups of agents at the shorter horizon but less so at the medium- and long-term horizons.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We examine the international propagation of the financial crisis of 2008, and compare it with that of the crisis of 1931. We argue that the collateral squeeze in the United States, which became intense after the failure of Lehman Brothers created doubts about the stability of other financial companies, was an important propagator in 2008. We identify some common features in the propagation of the two crises, the most important being the flight to liquidity and safety. In both crises, deposit outflows were not the only important sources of liquidity pressure on banks: in 1931, the central European acceptances of the London merchant banks were a serious problem, as, in 2008, were the liquidity commitments that commercial banks had provided to shadow banks. And in both crises, the behaviour of creditors towards debtors, and the valuation of assets by creditors, were very important. However, there was a very important difference between the two crises in the range and nature of assets that were regarded as liquid and safe. Central banks in 2008, with no gold standard constraint, could liquefy illiquid assets on a much greater scale.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The development of information and communications technology is opening up the opportunity for providing essential financial services to most people. Indeed, many mobile money or branchless banking schemes are currently spreading across the world. However, these schemes can only be sustainable if they are built on a commercially viable business model. In this respect, the jury is still out. The paper describes one commercially viable initiative in more detail, M-PESA in Kenya, and analyses in detail the transactions involved. It argues that in order to harness the potential of financial inclusion it is vital to permit experimentation with different business models. Regulation is therefore required that enables such experimentation by being calibrated to the type of service offered, but which can be tightened if and when such schemes become bigger with the potential to impact financial stability: risk-proportionate regulation by service type.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Global current account imbalances have been at the forefront of policy debates over the past few years. Many observers have recently singled them out as a key factor contributing to the global financial crisis. Current account surpluses in several emerging market economies are said to have helped fuel the credit booms and risk-taking in the major advanced deficit countries at the core of the crisis, by putting significant downward pressure on world interest rates and/or by simply financing the booms in those countries (the "excess saving" view). We argue that this perspective on global imbalances bears reconsideration. We highlight two conceptual problems: (i) drawing inferences about a country's cross-border financing activity based on observations of net capital flows; and (ii) explaining market interest rates through the saving-investment framework. We trace the shortcomings of this perspective to a failure to consider the distinguishing characteristics of a monetary economy. We conjecture that the main contributing factor to the financial crisis was not "excess saving" but the "excess elasticity" of the international monetary and financial system: the monetary and financial regimes in place failed to restrain the build-up of unsustainable credit and asset price booms ("financial imbalances").

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The 2007-2010 financial crisis highlighted the central role of financial intermediaries' stability in buttressing a smooth transmission of credit to borrowers. While results from the years prior to the crisis often cast doubts on the strength of the bank lending channel, recent evidence shows that bank-specific characteristics can have a large impact on the provision of credit. We show that new factors, such as changes in banks' business models and market funding patterns, had modified the monetary transmission mechanism in Europe and in the US prior to the crisis, and demonstrate the existence of structural changes during the period of financial crisis. Banks with weaker core capital positions, greater dependence on market funding and on non-interest sources of income restricted the loan supply more strongly during the crisis period. These findings support the Basel III focus on banks' core capital and on funding liquidity risks. They also call for a more forward-looking approach to the statistical data coverage of the banking sector by central banks. In particular, there should be a stronger focus on monitoring those financial factors that are likely to influence the functioning of the monetary transmission mechanism particularly in a period of crisis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Foreign exchange (FX) derivatives markets in the Korean won are comparatively thin and vulnerable to impaired functioning. During the crisis, Korea faced dislocations in its FX swap and cross-currency swap markets, so severe that covered interest parity (CIP) between the Korean won and the US dollar was seriously violated. Using a variation of the EGARCH model, we find that global market uncertainty - as proxied by VIX, the volatility index - was the main factor explaining the movement of deviations from CIP in the three-month FX swap market during the crisis period. The credit risk of Korean banks - as proxied by their credit default swap spread - was also a significant factor explaining deviations from CIP in the three-year cross-currency swap market before the crisis, while the credit risk of US banks was significant during the crisis period. The Bank of Korea's provision of funds using its own foreign reserves was not effective in reducing deviations from CIP, but the Bank of Korea's loans of the US dollar proceeds of swaps with the US Federal Reserve were effective. This is because the loans funded by swaps with the US Federal Reserve effectively added to Korea's foreign reserves and enhanced market confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Crisis experience has shown that as the financial intermediation chain lengthens, it becomes complicated to assess the risks of financial products due to a lack of transparency as to how risks are managed at different levels of the intermediation chain. Exchange-traded funds, which have become popular among investors seeking exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets, share this characteristic, especially when their returns are replicated using derivative products. As the volume of such products grows, such replication strategies can lead to a build-up of systemic risks in the financial system. This article examines the operational frameworks of exchange-traded funds and identifies potential channels through which risks to financial stability can materialise.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We develop a measure of systemic importance that accounts for the extent to which a bank propagates shocks across the banking system and is vulnerable to propagated shocks. Based on Shapley values, this measure gauges the contribution of interconnected banks to systemic risk, in contrast to other measures proposed in the literature. An empirical implementation of our measure reveals that systemic importance depends materially on the bank's role in the interbank network, both as a borrower and as a lender. We also find substantial differences between alternative measures, which implies that prudential authorities should be careful in choosing the underlying approach.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>A growing number of studies on the US subprime market indicate that, due to asymmetric information, credit risk transfer activities have perverse effects on banks' lending standards. We investigate a large part of the market for securitized assets ("prime mortgages") in Italy, a country with a regulatory framework analogous to the one prevalent in Europe. Information on over a million mortgages consists of loan-level variables, characteristics of the originating bank and, most importantly, contractual features of the securitization deal, including the seniority structure of the ABSs issued by the Special Purpose Vehicle and the amount retained by the originator. We borrow a robust way to test for the effects of asymmetric information from the empirical contract theory literature (Chiappori and Salanié, 2000). Overall, our evidence suggests that banks can effectively counter the negative effects of asymmetric information in the securitization market by selling less opaque loans, using signaling devices (i.e. retaining a share of the equity tranche of the ABSs issued by the SPV) and building up a reputation for not undermining their own lending standards.</p>

<p>We provide a new perspective on disagreement in inflation expectations by examining the full probability distributions of UK consumer inflation forecasts based on an adaptive bootstrap multimodality test. Furthermore, we compare the inflation forecasts of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) with those of UK consumers, for which we use data from the 2001-2007 February GfK NOP consumer surveys. Our analysis indicates substantial disagreement among UK consumers, and between the MPC and consumers, concerning one-year-ahead inflation forecasts. Such disagreement persisted throughout the sample, with no signs of convergence, consistent with consumers' inflation expectations not being "well-anchored" in the sense of matching the central bank's expectations. UK consumers had far more diverse views about future inflation than the MPC. It is possible that the MPC enjoyed certain information advantages which allowed it to have a narrower range of inflation forecasts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We assess the long-term economic impact of the new regulatory standards (the Basel III reform), answering the following questions. (1) What is the impact of the reform on long-term economic performance? (2) What is the impact of the reform on economic fluctuations? (3) What is the impact of the adoption of countercyclical capital buffers on economic fluctuations? The main results are the following. (1) Each percentage point increase in the capital ratio causes a median 0.09 percent decline in the level of steady state output, relative to the baseline. The impact of the new liquidity regulation is of a similar order of magnitude, at 0.08 percent. This paper does not estimate the benefits of the new regulation in terms of reduced frequency and severity of financial crisis, analysed in Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, 2010b). (2) The reform should dampen output volatility; the magnitude of the effect is heterogeneous across models; the median effect is modest. (3) The adoption of countercyclical capital buffers could have a more sizeable dampening effect on output volatility. These conclusions are fully consistent with those of reports by the Long-term Economic Impact group (BCBS, 2010b) and Macro Assessment Group (MAG, 2010b).</p>

<p>The recent financial crisis has highlighted the need to go beyond a purely micro approach to financial regulation and supervision. In recent months, the number of policy speeches, research papers and conferences that discuss a macro perspective on financial regulation has grown considerably. The policy debate is focusing in particular on macroprudential tools and their usage, their relationship with monetary policy, their implementation and their effectiveness. Macroprudential policy has recently also attracted considerable attention among researchers. This paper provides an overview of research on this topic. We also identify important future research questions that emerge from both the literature and the current policy debate.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Recurrent capital inflows pose important challenges for authorities in emerging market economies seeking to preserve financial stability. Raising interest rates to dampen imbalances that could arise from capital flows can also attract more capital inflows and accentuate appreciation pressures. For this reason authorities have used a number of instruments to mitigate the effects of capital flows, all with financial stability implications. Many of these instruments (eg reserve requirements) may have been used for other purposes but the global financial crisis has raised interest in examining them from a financial stability, or "macroprudential" perspective. This paper reviews some of these instruments, drawing in part on material provided by central banks to the BIS. The instruments include foreign exchange market intervention and foreign reserve accumulation; measures to strengthen bank balance sheets and capital and measures to maintain the quality of credit or to ifnluence credit growth or allocation, and capital controls. Certain implementation issues are also discussed, including signals to respond to, timing of prudential measures and procyclicality and effectiveness and calibration. An unresolved question is how the instruments described are to be used in conjunction with interest rate policy. Over the medium term, these instruments raise concerns because they may impair the development of the financial system.</p>

<p>This paper asks why Asia-Pacific residents issue debt in offshore markets and considers the implications for domestic debt markets. We use unit record data for bond issuance by non-government residents of Australia, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Singapore to link the decision to issue offshore to potential benefits. The results suggest that residents of smaller markets issue bonds offshore to arbitrage price differentials; to access foreign investors; and to issue larger, lower-rated or longer-maturity bonds. These bond characteristics tend to be correlated with offshore bond market size. The results support the notions that (i) deviations from covered interest parity are actively arbitraged by residents of minor currency areas, as well as by internationally active borrowers, as established in the literature; and (ii) issuers benefit from the liquidity and diversification of larger "complete" offshore markets. Against the potential benefits to borrowers, we consider the risks for both borrowers and the domestic market, and lessons from the ongoing financial crisis such as the benefits of funding diversification.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We compare the banking crises in 2008-09 and in the Great Depression, and analyse differences in the policy response to the two crises in light of the prevailing international monetary systems. The scale of the 2008-09 banking crisis, as measured by falls in international short-term indebtedness and total bank deposits, was smaller than that of 1931. However, central bank liquidity provision was larger in 2008-09 than in 1931, when it had been constrained in many countries by the gold standard. Liquidity shortages destroyed the international monetary system in 1931. By contrast, central bank liquidity could be, and was, provided much more freely in the flexible exchange rate environment of 2008-9. The amount of liquidity provided was 5 ½ - 7 ½ times as much as in 1931. This forestalled a general loss of confidence in the banking system. Drawing on historical experience, central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, established swap facilities quickly and flexibly to provide international liquidity, in some cases setting no upper limit to the amount that could be borrowed.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the impact of CDS trading on the development of the bond market in Asia. In general, CDS trading has lowered the cost of issuing bonds and enhanced the liquidity in the bond market. The positive impact is stronger for smaller firms, non-financial firms and those firms with higher liquidity in the CDS market. These empirical findings support the diversification and information hypotheses in the literature. Nevertheless, CDS trading has also introduced a new source of risk. There is strong evidence that, at the peak of the recent global financial crisis, those firms included in CDS indices faced higher bond yield spreads than those not included.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The establishment of independent authorities for monetary policy and for competition policy was part of the institutional consensus of the Great Moderation. The paper contrasts how policy has operated in the two spheres, especially as regards the role of law. It then discusses the application of competition policy to banks before and during the crisis, and relationships between competition and financial stability. Finally, the paper considers whether the financial crisis - which has led, at least temporarily, to unorthodox and less independent monetary and competition policies - has undermined the long-term case for independence. The conclusion is that it has not. While regulation of the financial system clearly requires fundamental reform, sound money and markets free from threats to competition remain fundamental to long-run prosperity; those ends are best pursued by focused and independent monetary and competition policies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The response of leading central banks to the current financial crisis has raised the magnitude of the financial and governance risks they face. An evaluation of the financial strength of a number of those banks suggests that they are in little danger of being forced by financial losses to alter their policies. Governance risks cannot be dismissed so lightly. In engaging extensively in unorthodox policies - bearing similarities to fiscal policy - a number of central banks have risked a critical examination of their governance structures and thereby potentially jeopardised their monetary policy independence. In order to forestall this risk to monetary policy, it is argued that unconventional policies be placed under a separate governance structure that would allow them to be brought under greater political control and accountability while preserving the operational independence of monetary policy.</p>

<p>There was a systemic failure of financial regulation: senior policymakers repeatedly enacted and implemented policies that destabilised the global financial system. They maintained these policies even as they learned of the consequences of their policies during the decade before the crisis. The crisis does not primarily reflect an absence of regulatory power, unclear lines of regulatory authority, capital account imbalances, or a lack of information by regulators. Rather, it represents the unwillingness of the policy apparatus to adapt to a dynamic, innovating financial system. A new institution is proposed to improve the design, implementation and modification of financial regulations.</p>

We show that the shift to the dollar occurred much earlier than conventionally supposed: during and immediately after World War I. Not just market forces but also policy support - the Fed in its role as market maker - was important for the dollar's overtaking of sterling as the leading international currency.</p>
<p>On balance, this experience challenges the popular notion of international currency status as being determined mainly by market size.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The paper examines the exercise, the efficiency, and the legitimacy of the monetary policy-making process. The goal of central bank autonomy in recent times is the outcome of a demand for price stability. The realisation of autonomy is also a consequence of the fragmentation of national decision making, in federal systems but also in regional and international monetary arrangements. Economic and financial crisis changes the political economy, and produces a transition from seeing the central bank as producing a general or universalisable good (price stability) to interpreting monetary policy as fundamentally a tool for redistributive or factional policies. The latter will only work in the framework of national policy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Although Central Banks have pursued the same objectives throughout their existence, primarily price and financial stability, the interpretation of their role in doing so has varied. We identify three stable epochs, when such interpretations had stabilised, ie</p>
<ol style="list-style-tag: alpha;">
<li>The Victorian era, 1840s to 1914;</li>
<li>The decades of government control, 1930s to 1960s;</li>
<li>The triumph of the markets, 1980s to 2007.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each epoch was followed by a confused inter-regnum, searching for a new consensual blueprint. The final such epoch concluded with a crisis, when it became apparent that macro-economic stability, the Great Moderation, plus (efficient) markets could not guarantee financial stability. So the search is now on for additional macro-prudential (counter-cyclical) instruments. The use of such instruments will need to be associated with controlled variations in systemic liquidity, and in the balance sheet of the Central Bank. Such control over its own balance sheet is the core, central function of any Central Bank, even more so than its role in setting short-term interest rates, which latter could be delegated. We end by surveying how relationships between Central Banks and governments may change over the next period.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We use a joint model of macroeconomic and term structure dynamics to estimate inflation risk premia in the United States and the euro area. To sharpen our estimation, we include in the information set macro data and survey data on inflation and interest rate expectations at various future horizons, as well as term structure data from both nominal and index-linked bonds. Our results show that, in both currency areas, inflation risk premia are relatively small, positive, and increasing in maturity. The cyclical dynamics of long-term inflation risk premia are mostly associated with changes in output gaps, while their high-frequency fluctuations seem to be aligned with variations in inflation.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This study outlines a methodology for mapping the increases in capital and liquidity requirements proposed under Basel III to bank lending spreads. The higher cost associated with a one percentage point increase in the capital ratio can be recovered by increasing lending spreads by 15 basis points for a representative bank. This calculation assumes the return on equity (ROE) and the cost of debt are unchanged, with no change in other sources of income and no reduction in operating expenses. If ROE and the cost of debt are assumed to decline, the impact on lending spreads is reduced. To recover the additional cost of meeting the December 2009 proposal for the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a representative bank would need to increase lending spreads by 24 basis points. Taking into account the fall in risk-weighted assets from holding more government bonds reduces this cost to 12 basis points or less.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>What are the main drivers of fluctuations in the aggregate US stock market? In this paper, we attempt to resolve the long-lasting debate surrounding this question by designing and solving a consumption-based asset pricing model which incorporates stochastic volatility, long-run risks in consumption and dividends, and Epstein-Zin preferences. Utilizing Bayesian MCMC techniques, we estimate the model by fitting it to US data on the level of the aggregate US stock market, the short-term real risk-free interest rate, real consumption growth, and real dividend growth. Our results indicate that, over short and medium horizons, fluctuations in the level of the aggregate US stock market are mainly driven by changes in expected excess returns. Conversely, low frequency movements in the aggregate stock market are primarily driven by changes in the expected long-run growth rate of real dividends.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper provides evidence that interbank markets are tiered rather than flat, in the sense that most banks do not lend to each other directly but through money center banks acting as intermediaries. We capture the concept of tiering by developing a core-periphery model, and devise a procedure for fitting the model to real-world networks. Using Bundesbank data on bilateral interbank exposures among 1800 banks, we find strong evidence of tiering in the German banking system. Econometrically, bank-specific features, such as balance sheet size, predict how banks position themselves in the interbank market. This link provides a promising avenue for understanding the formation of financial networks.</p>

<p>The Chinese authorities described the management of the renminbi after its 2005 unpegging from the US dollar as involving a basket of trading partner currencies. Outside analysts have detected few signs of such management. We find that, in the two years from mid-2006 to mid-2008, the renminbi strengthened gradually against trading partners' currencies within a narrow band. In mid-2008, the financial crisis interrupted this experiment and the bilateral renminbi/dollar exchange rate stabilised at 6.8. The 2006-08 experience suggests that a shared policy of gradual nominal effective appreciation renders East Asian currencies quite stable against one another. Such a shared policy would create favourable conditions for regional monetary cooperation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We show in this paper that offshore markets intermediate a large chunk of financial transactions in major reserve currencies such as the US dollar. We argue that, for emerging market economies that are interested in seeing some international use of their currencies, offshore markets can help to increase the recognition and acceptance of the currency while still allowing the authorities to retain a measure of control over the pace of capital account liberalisation. The development of offshore markets could pose risks to monetary and financial stability in the home economy which need to be prudently managed. The experience of the Federal Reserve and of the authorities of the other major reserve currency economies in dealing with the euromarkets shows that policy options are available for managing such risks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>During the financial crisis of 2007/08 the level and volatility of interest rate spreads increased dramatically. This paper examines how the choice of the target interest rate for monetary policy affects the volatility of inflation, the output gap and the yield curve. We consider three monetary policy operating procedures with different target interest rates: a one-month market rate, a three-month market rate and an essentially riskless one-month repo rate. The implementation tool is the one-month repo rate for all three operating procedures. In a highly stylised model, we find that using a money market rate as a target rate generally yields lower variability of the macroeconomic variables. This holds under discretion as well as under commitment both in times of financial calm or turmoil. Whether the one month or three month rate procedure performs best depends on the maturity of the specific rate that enters the IS curve.</p>

<p>The paper investigates how ageing will affect asset prices. A small model is used to show that economic and demographic factors drive asset, and in particular house, prices. These factors are estimated in a panel regression framework encompassing BIS real house price data from 22 advanced economies between 1970 and 2009. The estimates show that demographic factors affect real house prices significantly. Combining the results with UN population projections suggests that ageing will lower real house prices substantially over the next forty years. The headwind is around 80 basis points per annum in the United States and much stronger in Europe and Japan. Based on the analysis, global asset prices are likely to face substantial headwinds from ageing.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper provides some general lessons for the design of countercyclical capital buffers. Its main empirical contribution is to analyse conditioning variables which could guide the build-up and release of capital. A major distinction for countercyclical capital schemes is whether conditioning variables are bank-specific or system-wide. The evidence presented in the paper indicates that the idiosyncratic component can be sizeable when a bank-specific approach is used. This makes a system-wide approach preferable, for which the best variables as signal for the pace and size of the accumulation of the buffers are not necessarily the best for the timing and intensity of the release. The credit-to-GDP ratio seems best for the build-up phase. Some measure of aggregate losses, possibly combined with indicators of credit conditions, seem to perform well for signalling the beginning of the release phase. Nonetheless, the analysis indicates that designing a fully rule-based mechanism may not be possible at this stage as some degree of judgment seems inevitable. A parallel exercise indicates that reducing the sensitivity of the minimum capital requirement is an important element of a credible countercyclical buffer scheme.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Funding liquidity risk has played a key role in all historical banking crises. Nevertheless, a measure based on publicly available data remains so far elusive. We address this gap by showing that aggressive bidding at central bank auctions reveals funding liquidity risk. We can extract an insurance premium from banks' bids which we propose as measure of funding liquidity risk. Using a unique data set consisting of all bids in the main refinancing operation auctions conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and October 2008 we find that funding liquidity risk is typically stable and low, with occasional spikes, especially around key events during the recent crisis. We also document downward spirals between funding liquidity risk and market liquidity. As measurement without clear definitions is impossible, we initially provide definitions of funding liquidity and funding liquidity risk.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper studies the nature of spillover effects in bank lending flows from advanced to the emerging market economies and identifies specific channels through which such effects occur. Based on a gravity model we examine a panel data set on cross-border bank flows from 17 advanced to 28 emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America and central and eastern Europe from 1993 to 2008. The empirical analysis suggests that global as well as country specific factors are significant determinants of cross-border bank flows. Greater global risk aversion and expected financial market volatility seem to have been the most important factors behind the decrease in cross-border bank flows during the crisis of 2007-08. The decrease in cross-border loans to central and eastern Europe was more limited compared to Asia and Latin America, in large measure because of the higher degree of financial and monetary integration in Europe, and relatively sound banking systems in the region. These results are robust to various specification, sub-samples and econometric methodologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The impact of currency collapses (ie large nominal depreciations or devaluations) on real output remains unsettled in the empirical macroeconomic literature. This paper provides new empirical evidence on this relationship using a dataset for 108 emerging and developing economies for the period 1960-2006. We provide estimates of how these episodes affect growth and output trend. Our main finding is that currency collapses are associated with a permanent output loss relative to trend, which is estimated to range between 2% and 6% of GDP. However, we show that such losses tend to materialise before the drop in the value of the currency, which suggests that the costs of a currency crash largely stem from the factors leading to it. Taken on its own (ie ceteris paribus) we find that currency collapses tend to have a positive effect on output. More generally, we also find that the likelihood of a positive growth rate in the year of the collapse is over two times more likely than a contraction; and that positive growth rates in the years that follow such episodes are the norm. Finally, we show that the persistence of the crash matters, ie one-time events induce exchange rate and output dynamics that differ from consecutive episodes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The conventional view is that microeconomic reforms after the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis have greatly strengthened banking systems in Asia. Banks have become better capitalised, external exposures have been reduced and credit risk has been managed more effectively. But this conventional view does not take enough account of the macroeconomic background. A sharp rise in domestic savings, combined with the recent large-scale sterilised intervention and easy monetary policy, has led to very easy financing conditions for banks. Bank credit expanded. Banks have accumulated a large stock of government bonds. How these conditions will change and how this will affect banks in Asia is uncertain. Supervisory authorities therefore need to be sure that the present very liquid position of most banking systems in Asia does not allow significant (but so far only latent) increases in market and credit risk to go undetected.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The saving rate of China is high from many perspectives - historical experience, international standards and the predictions of economic models. Furthermore, the average saving rate has been rising over time, with much of the increase taking place in the 2000s, so that the aggregate marginal propensity to save exceeds 50%. What really sets China apart from the rest of the world is that the rising aggregate saving has reflected high savings rates in all three sectors - corporate, household and government. Moreover, adjusting for inflation alters interpretations of the time path of the propensity to save in the three sectors. Our evidence casts doubt on the proposition that distortions and subsidies account for China's rising corporate profits and high saving rate. Instead, we argue that tough corporate restructuring (including pension and home ownership reforms), a marked Lewis-model transformation process (where the average wage exceeds the marginal product of labour in the subsistence sector) and rapid ageing process have all played more important roles. While such structural factors suggest that the Chinese saving rate will peak in the medium term, policies for job creation and a stronger social safety net would assist the transition to more balanced domestic demand.</p>

<p>How does the management and resolution of the current crisis compare with the response of the Nordic countries in the early 1990s, widely regarded as exemplary? We argue that, while intervention has been prompter, the measures taken so far remain less comprehensive and in-depth. In particular, the cleansing of balance sheets has proceeded more slowly, and less attention has been paid to reducing excess capacity and avoiding competitive distortions. In general, policymakers have given higher priority to sustaining aggregate demand in the short term than to encouraging adjustment in the financial sector and containing moral hazard. We argue that three factors largely explain this outcome: the more international nature of the crisis; the complexity of the instruments involved; and, hardly appreciated so far, the effect of accounting practices on the dynamics of the events, reflecting in particular the prominent role of fair value accounting (and mark to market losses) in relation to amortised cost accounting for loan books. There is a risk that the policies followed so far may delay the establishment of the basis for a sustainably profitable and less risk-prone financial sector.</p>

<p>The financial crisis that began in August 2007 has blurred the sharp distinction between monetary and financial stability. It has also led to a revival of practical central bank co-operation. This paper explains how things have changed. The main innovation in central bank cooperation during this crisis was the emergency provision of international liquidity through bilateral central bank swap facilities, which have evolved to form interconnected swap networks. We discuss the reasons for establishing swap facilities, relate the probability of a country receiving a swap line in a currency to a measure of currency-specific liquidity shortages based on the BIS international banking statistics, and find a significant relationship in the case of the US dollar, the euro, the yen and the Swiss franc. We also discuss the role and effectiveness of swap lines in relieving currency-specific liquidity shortages, the risks that central banks run in extending swap lines and the limitations to their utility in relieving liquidity pressures. We conclude that the credit crisis is likely to have a lasting effect on the international liquidity policies of governments and central banks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Global risk maps are unified databases that provide risk exposure data to supervisors and the broader financial market community worldwide. We think of them as giant matrices that track the bilateral (firm-level) exposures of banks, non-bank financial institutions and other relevant market participants. While useful in principle, these giant matrices are unlikely to materialise outside the narrow and targeted efforts currently being pursued in the supervisory domain. This reflects the well known trade-offs between the macro and micro dimensions of data collection and dissemination. It is possible, however, to adapt existing statistical reporting frameworks in ways that would facilitate an analysis of exposures and build-ups of risk over time at the <strong>aggregate </strong>(sectoral) level. To do so would move us significantly in the direction of constructing the ideal global risk map. It would also help us sidestep the complex legal challenges surrounding the sharing or dissemination of firm-level data, and it would support a two-step approach to systemic risk monitoring. That is, the alarms sounded by the aggregate data would yield the critical pieces of information to inform targeted analysis of more detailed data at the firm- or market-level.</p>

<p>An operational macroprudential approach to financial stability requires tools that attribute system-wide risk to individual institutions. Making use of constructs from game theory, we propose an attribution methodology that has a number of appealing features: it can be used in conjunction with popular risk measures, it provides measures of institutions’ systemic importance that add up exactly to the measure of system-wide risk and it easily accommodates uncertainty about the validity of the risk model. We apply this methodology to a number of constructed examples and illustrate the interactions between drivers of systemic importance: size, the institution’s risk profile and strength of exposures to common risk factors. We also demonstrate how the methodology can be used for the calibration of macroprudential capital rules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In practice, central banks have been confronted with a trade-off between stabilising inflation and output when dealing with rising oil prices. This contrasts with the result in the standard New Keynesian model that ensuring complete price stability is the optimal thing to do, even when an oil shock leads to large output drops. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, this paper investigates how monetary policy should react to oil shocks in a microfounded model with staggered price-setting and with oil as an input in a CES production function. In particular, we extend Benigno and Woodford (2005) to obtain a second order approximation to the expected utility of the representative household when the steady state is distorted and the economy is hit by oil price shocks.</p>
<p>The main result is that oil price shocks generate an endogenous trade-off between inflation and output stabilisation when oil has low substitutability in production. Therefore, it becomes optimal for the monetary authority to stabilise partially the effects of oil shocks on inflation and some inflation is desirable. We also find, in contrast to Benigno and Woodford (2005), that this trade-off is reduced, but not eliminated, when we get rid of the effects of monopolistic distortions in the steady state. Moreover, the size of the endogenous "cost-push" shock generated by fluctuations in the oil price increases when oil is more difficult to substitute by other factors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that the recent generation of DSGE models failed to incorporate many of the liquidity and financial accelerator mechanisms revealed in the global financial crisis that began in 2007. This paper complements the papers presented at the 2009 BIS annual conference focused on the role of banks and other financial institutions by analysing the role of household decisions and their interplay with credit conditions and asset prices in the light of empirical evidence. In DSGE models without financial frictions, asset prices are merely a proxy for income growth expectations and play no separate role. On UK aggregate consumption evidence, section 2 of the paper shows this is strongly contradicted by the data, for all possible discount rates and both for a perfect foresight and an empirical rational expectations approach to measuring income expectations. However, an Ando-Modigliani consumption function generalised to include a role for liquidity, uncertainty, time varying credit conditions, wealth and housing collateral effects, as well as income expectations, explains the data well. Section 3 reports new evidence on the striking rejection on aggregate data of the consumption Euler equation central to all DSGE models. Section 4 shows that UK micro evidence is consistent with the generalised Ando-Modigliani model. Section 5 discusses the limitations of recent DSGE models with financial frictions and housing. Section 6 discusses some business cycle implications of amplification mechanisms and non-linearities operating via households and residential construction. It reconsiders econometric methodology appropriate for designing better evidence-based central bank policy models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Is there any need to “clean” up a banking system in the midst of a crisis, by closing or recapitalizing weak banks and taking bad assets off bank balance sheets, or can one wait till the crisis is over? We argue that an “overhang” of impaired banks that may be forced to sell assets soon can reduce the current price of illiquid assets sufficiently that weak banks have no interest in selling them. Anticipating a potential future fire sale, cash rich buyers have high expected returns to holding cash, which also reduces their incentive to lock up money in term loans. The potential for a worse fire sale than necessary, as well as the associated decline in credit origination, could make the crisis worse, which is one reason it may make sense to clean up the system even in the midst of the crisis. We discuss alternative ways of cleaning up the system, and the associated costs and benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Securitization was meant to disperse credit risk to those who were better able to bear it. In practice, securitization appears to have concentrated the risks in the financial intermediary sector itself. This paper outlines an accounting framework for the financial system for assessing the impact of securitization on financial stability. If securitization leads to the lengthening of intermediation chains, then risks becomes concentrated in the intermediary sector with damaging consequences for financial stability. Covered bonds are one form of securitization that do not fall foul of this principle. I discuss the role of countercyclial capital requirements and the Spanish-style statistical provisioning in mitigating the harmful effects of lengthening intermediation chains.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The recent crisis was characterized by massive illiquidity. This paper reviews what we know and don't know about illiquidity and all its friends: market freezes, fire sales, contagion, and ultimately insolvencies and bailouts. It first explains why liquidity cannot easily be apprehended through a single statistics, and asks whether liquidity should be regulated given that a capital adequacy requirement is already in place. The paper then analyzes market breakdowns due to either adverse selection or shortages of financial muscle, and explains why such breakdowns are endogenous to balance sheet choices and to information acquisition. It then looks at what economics can contribute to the debate on systemic risk and its containment.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper takes a macroeconomic perspective, discusses shortages of aggregate liquidity and analyses how market value accounting and capital adequacy should react to asset prices. It concludes with a topical form of liquidity provision, monetary bailouts and recapitalizations, and analyses optimal combinations thereof; it stresses the need for macro-prudential policies.</p>

<p>Since the start of the financial crisis, industrial country public debt levels have increased dramatically. And they are set to continue rising for the foreseeable future. A number of countries face the prospect of large and rising future costs related to the ageing of their populations. In this paper, we examine what current fiscal policy and expected future age-related spending imply for the path of debt/GDP ratios over the next several decades. Our projections of public debt ratios lead us to conclude that the path pursued by fiscal authorities in a number of industrial countries is unsustainable. Drastic measures are necessary to check the rapid growth of current and future liabilities of governments and reduce their adverse consequences for long-term growth and monetary stability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The governance of central banks has two dimensions: corporate governance and public governance. Public governance is an institutional framework whereby the general public governs a central bank by and through the legislative and executive bodies in a country. This paper argues that the literature of new institutional economics sheds new light on the public governance of central banks. First, Williamson’s theory of "governance as integrity" (probity) is applied to the internal management of central banks. Moe’s theory of "public bureaucracy" is applied to the concept of central bank independence. Second, we apply agency theory to the issues associated with central bank independence and accountability. Third, public choice theory is applied to central bank independence.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the relationship between short-term interest rates and bank risk. Using a unique database that includes quarterly balance sheet information for listed banks operating in the European Union and the United States in the last decade, we find evidence that unusually low interest rates over an extended period of time contributed to an increase in banks' risk. This result holds for a wide range of measures of risk, as well as macroeconomic and institutional controls.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>A central proposition in research on the role that banks play in the transmission mechanism is that monetary policy imparts a direct impact on deposits and that deposits, insofar as they constitute the supply of loanable funds, act as the driving force of bank lending. This paper argues that the emphasis on policy-induced changes in deposits is misplaced. A reformulation of the bank lending channel is proposed that works primarily through the impact of monetary policy on banks' balance sheet strength and risk perception. Such a recasting implies, contrary to conventional wisdom, that greater reliance on market-based funding enhances the importance of the channel. The framework also shows how banks, depending on the strength of their balance sheets, could act either as absorbers or amplifiers of shocks originiating in the financial system.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper extends the approach of measuring and stress-testing the systemic risk of a banking sector in Huang, Zhou, and Zhu (2009) to identifying various sources of financial instability and to allocating systemic risk to individual financial institutions. The systemic risk measure, defined as the insurance cost to protect against distressed losses in a banking system, is a summary indicator of market perceived risk that reflects expected default risk of individual banks, risk premia as well as correlated defaults. An application of our methodology to a portfolio of twenty-two major banks in Asia and the Pacific illustrates the dynamics of the spillover effects of the global financial crisis to the region. The increase in the perceived systemic risk, particularly after the failure of Lehman Brothers, was mainly driven by the heightened risk aversion and the squeezed liquidity. Further analysis, which is based on our proposed approach to quantifying the marginal contribution of individual banks to the systemic risk, suggests that “too-big-to-fail” is a valid concern from a macroprudential perspective of bank regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Standard models of international risk sharing with complete asset markets predict a positive association between relative consumption growth and real exchange-rate depreciations across countries. The striking lack of evidence for this link - the consumption/real-exchange-rate anomaly or Backus-Smith puzzle - has prompted research on risk-sharing indicators with incomplete asset markets. That research generally implies that the association holds in forecasts, rather than realizations. Using professional forecasts for 28 countries for 1990-2008 we find no such association, thus deepening the puzzle. Independent evidence on the weak link between forecasts for consumption and real interest rates suggests that the presence of 'hand-to-mouth' consumers may help to explain the evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The quality of newly originated subprime mortgages had been visibly deteriorating for some time before the window for such loans was shut in 2007. Nevertheless, a bankruptcy court's directed ex post examination of New Century Financial, one of the largest originators of subprime mortgages, discovered no change, over time, in how that firm went about its business. This paper employs the court examiner's findings in a critical review of the procedures used by various agents involved in the origination and securitisation of subprime mortgages. A contribution of this paper is its elaboration of the choices and incentives faced by the various types of institutions involved in those linked processes of origination and securitisation. It highlights the limited roles played by the originators of subprime loans in screening borrowers and in bearing losses on defective loans that had been sold to securitisers of pooled loan packages (ie, mortgage-backed securities). It also illustrates the willingness of the management of those institutions that became key players in that market to put their reputations with fixed-income investor clients in jeopardy. What is perplexing is that such risk exposures were accepted by investing firms that had the wherewithal and knowledge to appreciate the overall paucity of due diligence in the loan origination processes. This observation, in turn, points to the conclusion that the subprime episode is a case in which reputational capital, a presumptively effective motivator of market discipline, was not an effective incentive device.</p>

In the process, it questions a number of commonly held beliefs that have become part of the conventional wisdom. The paper is organised around ten propositions that cover the following issues: the distinction between idiosyncratic and systematic elements of liquidity crises; the growing reliance on funding liquidity in a market-based financial system; the role of payment and settlement systems; the need to improve liquidity buffers; the desirability of putting in place (variable) speed limits in the financial system; the proper role of (retail) deposit insurance schemes; the double-edged sword nature of liquidity provision by central banks; the often misunderstood role of "monetary base" injections in addressing liquidity disruptions; the need to develop principles for the provision of central bank liquidity; and the need to reconsider the preventive role of monetary (interest rate) policy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The recent global financial crisis has led central banks to rely heavily on "unconventional" monetary policies. This alternative approach to policy has generated much discussion and a heated and at times confusing debate. The debate has been complicated by the use of different definitions and conflicting views of the mechanisms at work. This paper sets out a framework for classifying and thinking about such policies, highlighting how they can be viewed within the overall context of monetary policy implementation. The framework clarifies the differences among the various forms of unconventional monetary policy, provides a systematic characterisation of the wide range of central bank responses to the crisis, helps to underscore the channels of transmission, and identifies some of the main policy challenges. In the process, the paper also addresses a number of contentious analytical issues, notably the role of bank reserves and their inflationary consequences.</p>

<p>Among the policy responses to the global financial crisis, the international provision of US dollars via central bank swap lines stands out. This paper studies the build-up of stresses on banks' balance sheets that led to this coordinated policy response. Using the BIS international banking statistics, we reconstruct the worldwide consolidated balance sheets of the major national banking systems. This allows us to investigate the structure of banks' global operations across their offices in various countries, shedding light on how their international asset positions are funded across currencies and counterparties. The analysis first highlights why a country's "national balance sheet", a residency-based measure, can be a misleading guide to where the vulnerabilities faced by that country's national banking system (or residents) lie. It then focuses on banking systems' consolidated balance sheets, and shows how the growth (since 2000) in European and Japanese banks' US dollar assets produced structural US dollar funding requirements, setting the stage for the dollar shortage when interbank and swap markets became impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>A large body of literature has shown that small firms experience difficulties in accessing the credit market due to informational asymmetries. Banks can overcome these asymmetries through relationship lending, or at least mitigate their effects by asking for collateral. Small firms, especially if they are young, have little collateral and short credit histories, and thus may find it difficult to raise funds from banks. In this paper, we show that even in this case, small firms may improve their borrowing capacity by joining mutual guarantee institutions (MGIs). Our empirical analysis shows that small firms affiliated with MGIs pay less for credit compared with similar firms which are not MGI members. We obtain this result for interest rates charged on loan contracts which are not backed by mutual guarantees. We then argue that our findings are consistent with the view that MGIs are better than banks at screening and monitoring opaque borrowers. Thus, banks benefit from the willingness of MGIs to post collateral since it implies that firms are better screened and monitored.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper examines the power of different contractual mechanisms to influence an originator’s choice of costly effort to screen borrowers when the originator plans to securitise its loans. The analysis focuses on three potential mechanisms: the originator holds a “vertical slice”, or share of the portfolio; the originator holds the equity tranche of a structured finance transaction; the originator holds the mezzanine tranche, rather than the equity tranche. These mechanisms will result in differing levels of screening, and the differences arise from varying sensitivities to a systematic risk factor. Equity tranche retention is not always the most effective mechanism, and the equity tranche can be dominated by either a vertical slice or a mezzanine tranche if the probability of a downturn is likely and if the equity tranche is likely to be depleted in a downturn. If the choice of how much and what form to retain is left up to the originator, the retention mechanism may lead to low screening effort, suggesting a potential rationale for government intervention.</p>

The study distinguishes the impact on creditors as seen in the change of CDS spreads from the impact on shareholders as seen in the movement of bank stock prices. Government interventions benefited creditors at the expense of shareholders, with bank CDS spreads narrowing around the announcements in all cases. Despite a brief positive reaction, bank stock prices continued to underperform in all countries except the United States where the favourable terms of the government support allowed bank stocks to outperform.</p>

<p>We present empirical evidence that the Thai exchange rate is driven in part by international investors' cross-border portfolio rebalancing decisions. Our results are based on two comprehensive, daily-frequency datasets of foreign exchange and equity market capital flows undertaken by nonresident investors in Thailand in 2005 and 2006. We find that net purchases of Thai equities by nonresident investors lead to an appreciation of the Thai baht. In addition, higher returns in the Thai equity market relative to a reference stock market are associated both with net sales of Thai equities by these investors and with a depreciation of the Thai baht. Foreign investors do not appear to hedge the foreign exchange risk related to their equity market positions. Despite this, we find that exchange rate movements were not key drivers of nonresident investors' equity market investment choices in our sample period.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>China’s emergence as a major player in world trade is well known, but its rising role in global finance is perhaps underappreciated. China is the second largest creditor in the world today, with a net creditor position of exceeding 30% of GDP in 2007. In this paper, we test the importance of growth differential, demographics, government debt, financial depth and the exchange rate in shaping China’s net foreign asset position. Our findings highlight the sharp fall in youth dependency as one key driver behind China’s puzzlingly large net lender position and also confirm the neoclassical prediction that faster growth attracts more capital inflows. Looking ahead, our findings also suggest that China is unlikely to turn into a meaningful net debtor nation over the next two decades. Moreover, we project that, as China engages in increased cross-border asset trade, its gross foreign assets and liabilities could triple in 10 years. While adjustments in China’s net foreign asset position are expected to be gradual and may thus facilitate its capital account opening, increasing exposure to external shocks and growing interactions with the rest of the world may present challenges both to China and to the global financial system.</p>

<p>This paper investigates dislocations in the foreign exchange (FX) swap market between the US dollar and three major European currencies. After the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) were negatively associated with the creditworthiness of US financial institutions (as well as that of European institutions), consistent with the deepening of a dollar liquidity problem into a global phenomenon. US dollar term funding auctions by the ECB, SNB, and BoE, as well as the US Federal Reserve commitment to provide unlimited dollar swap lines are found to have ameliorated the FX swap market dislocations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Over the last decade or so, addressing financial instability has become a policy priority. Despite the efforts made, policymakers are still a long way from developing a satisfactory operational framework. A major challenge complicating this task is the "fuzziness" with which financial (in)stability can be measured. We review the available measurement methodologies and point out several weaknesses. In particular, we caution against heavy reliance on the current generation of macro stress tests, arguing that they can lull policymakers into a false sense of security. Nonetheless, we argue that the "fuzziness" in measurement does not prevent further progress towards an operational framework, as long as it is appropriately accounted for. Crucial features of that framework include: strengthening the macroprudential orientation of financial regulation and supervision; addressing more systematically the procyclicality of the financial system; relying as far as possible on automatic stabilisers rather than discretion, thereby lessening the burden on the real-time measurement of financial stability risks; and setting up institutional arrangements that leverage the comparative expertise of the various authorities involved in safeguarding financial stability, not least financial supervisors and central banks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper highlights relative price adjustments taking place in the global economy as important sources of the lower levels of inflation rates observed in the recent decades. Using a markup model, it shows substantial effects from declines in wage costs and import prices relative to consumer prices. Out of the 5 percentage point decline in the inflation rates in eight OECD countries from 1970-1989 to 1990-2006, global shocks to two relative prices account for more than 1.5 percentage points, while a monetary policy shock accounts for another 1 percentage point.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper shows empirically that China's trade balance is sensitive to fluctuations in the real effective exchange rate of the renminbi. However, the current size of the trade surplus is such that exchange rate policy alone will probably not be able to address the imbalance. The potential reduction in the trade surplus resulting from an increase in the renminbi exchange rate is limited mainly because Chinese imports do not react as expected to a renminbi appreciation - they tend to fall rather than increase. By estimating bilateral import equations for China and its major trade partners, we find that the reaction for imports is generally confirmed for China's trade with Southeast Asian countries. That result might be attributable to Asia's vertical integration, as a large share of Chinese imports from Southeast Asia are re-exported. We also find that total exports from a number of Asian countries react negatively to a renminbi appreciation, which points to a dependence of Asian countries' exports on those of China.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In this paper we propose a framework for measuring and stress testing the systemic risk of a group of major financial institutions. The systemic risk is measured by the price of insurance against financial distress, which is based on ex ante measures of default probabilities of individual banks and forecasted asset return correlations. Importantly, using realized correlations estimated from high-frequency equity return data can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasted correlations. Our stress testing methodology, using an integrated micro-macro model, takes into account dynamic linkages between the health of major US banks and macro-financial conditions. Our results suggest that the theoretical insurance premium that would be charged to protect against losses that equal or exceed 15 % of total liabilities of 12 major US financial firms stood at $110 billion in March 2008 and had a projected upper bound of $250 billion in July 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Why should risk management systems account for parameter uncertainty? In order to answer this question, this paper lets an investor in a credit portfolio face non-diversifiable estimation-driven uncertainty about two parameters: probability of default and asset-return correlation. Bayesian inference reveals that - for realistic assumptions about the portfolio's credit quality and the data underlying parameter estimates - this uncertainty substantially increases the tail risk perceived by the investor. Since incorporating parameter uncertainty in a measure of tail risk is computationally demanding, the paper also derives and analyzes a closed-form approximation to such a measure.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper investigates the market pricing of subprime mortgage risk on the basis of data for the ABX.HE family of indices, which have become a key barometer of mortgage market conditions during the recent financial crisis. After an introduction into ABX index mechanics and a discussion of historical pricing patterns, we use regression analysis to establish the relationship between observed index returns and macroeconomic news as well as market-based proxies of default risk, interest rates, liquidity and risk appetite. The results imply that declining risk appetite and heightened concerns about market illiquidity - likely due in part to significant short positioning activity - have provided a sizeable contribution to the observed collapse in ABX prices since the summer of 2007. In particular, while fundamental factors, such as indicators of housing market activity, have continued to exert an important influence on the subordinated ABX indices, those backed by AA and AAA exposures have tended to react more to the general deterioration of the financial market environment. This provides further support for the inappropriateness of pricing models that do not sufficiently account for factors such as risk appetite and liquidity risk, particularly in periods of heightened market pressure. In addition, as related risk premia can be captured by unconstrained investors, ABX pricing patterns appear to lend support to government measures aimed at taking troubled assets off banks' balance sheets - such as the US Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We extend the basic (representative-household) New Keynesian [NK] model of the monetary transmission mechanism to allow for a spread between the interest rate available to savers and borrowers, that can vary for either exogenous or endogenous reasons. We find that the mere existence of a positive average spread makes little quantitative difference for the predicted effects of particular policies. Variation in spreads over time is of greater significance, with consequences both for the equilibrium relation between the policy rate and aggregate expenditure and for the relation between real activity and inflation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we find that the target criterion - a linear relation that should be maintained between the inflation rate and changes in the output gap - that characterises optimal policy in the basic NK model continues to provide a good approximation to optimal policy, even in the presence of variations in credit spreads. We also consider a "spread-adjusted Taylor rule", in which the intercept of the Taylor rule is adjusted in proportion to changes in credit spreads. We show that while such an adjustment can improve upon an unadjusted Taylor rule, the optimal degree of adjustment is less than 100 percent; and even with the correct size of adjustment, such a rule of thumb remains inferior to the targeting rule.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract and executive summary:</strong></p>
<p>China's financial conundrum arises from two sources: (1) its large trade (saving) surplus results in a currency mismatch because it is an immature creditor that cannot lend in its own currency. Instead foreign currency claims (largely dollars) build up within domestic financial institutions. And (2), economists - both American and Chinese - mistakenly attribute the surpluses to an undervalued renminbi. To placate the United States, the result is a gradual appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar of 6 percent or more per year. This predictable appreciation since 2004, and the fall in US interest rates since mid 2007, not only attracts hot money inflows but inhibits private capital outflows from financing (compensating?) China's huge trade surplus. This one-way bet in the foreign exchange markets can no longer be offset by relatively low interest rates in China compared to the United States, as had been the case in 2005-06. Thus, the People's Bank of China (PBC) now must intervene heavily to prevent the renminbi from ratcheting upwards - and so becomes the country's sole international financial intermediary.</p>
<p>Despite massive efforts by the PBC to sterilise the monetary consequences of the reserve buildup, inflation in China is increasing, with excess liquidity that spills over into the world economy. China has been transformed from a deflationary force on American and European price levels into an inflationary one. Because of the currency mismatch, floating the RMB is neither feasible nor desirable - and a higher RMB would not reduce China's trade surplus. Instead, monetary control and normal private-sector finance for the trade surplus require a return to a credibly fixed nominal yuan/dollar rate similar to that which existed between 1995 and 2004. But for any newly reset yuan/dollar rate to be credible as a monetary anchor, foreign "China bashing" to get the RMB up must end.</p>
<p>Currency stabilisation would allow the PBC to regain monetary control and quash inflation. Only then can the Chinese government take decisive steps to reduce the trade (saving) surplus by tax cuts, increased social expenditures, and higher dividend payouts. But as long as the economy remains overheated, the government hesitates to take these trade-surplus-reducing measures because of their near-term inflationary consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Empirical evidence on whether the euro area monetary transmission process has changed is, at best, mixed. We argue that this inconclusiveness is likely to be due to the fact that existing empirical studies concentrate on the effects of a particular development on a specific transmission channel. Another problem of this literature is that specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy, leaving open the question whether the ability of monetary policy to control inflation has been altered. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard VAR for the euro area and by searching for a possible break date. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare impulse responses to a monetary policy shock for these episodes and find that the well-known "stylised facts" of monetary policy transmission remain valid. Therefore, we argue that the general guiding principles of the Eurosystem monetary policy remain adequate. Moreover, it seems that monetary transmission after 1998 is not very different from before 1996, but probably very different in the interim period. This implies that evidence for the euro area could be biased by an "atypical" interim period 1996-1999.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Monetary economics as practiced by central bank modelers has made a great deal of progress in recent years. In a 2002 paper I interviewed research economists at four central banks and surveyed the models in use at those banks. I criticized the models for having lost all touch with statistical inference and with its connection to decision theory. I also criticized them for not following the rational expectations literature by jointly specifying and estimating the equations in their systems. And I pointed out that none of the models had a consistent treatment of asset markets. Since then many central banks, taking advantage of the new computational methods for Bayesian inference that economists are learning to use, have made substantial progress toward meeting the first two of these criticisms. They have still for the most part done little about the third. And academic economists are beginning to question some of the standard assumptions in the rational expectations framework that underlies these models.</p>
<p>Recent events in financial markets, and the difficulties that they raise for central banks, make it painfully clear that even the frontier Bayesian DSGE models like that in use at the Swedish Riksbank do not model asset markets in any depth. But the problem goes beyond that: these models, and most academic macro models as well, assume a standard rational expectations framework: there is only one probability measure in play, the "true" probability measure from which nature draws realizations. Agents in the model form expectations using this true distribution, conditioning on information sets that consist of all information in the model dated t and earlier. It is well documented that people do not actually behave this way, and in the literature on behavioral finance there is some suggestion that deviations from this standardized assumption of rational behavior given a common probability distribution may be important.</p>
<p>The recent events in financial markets - the dotcom boom, the US house price boom, perhaps the continuing commodity price boom - look to some observers like bubbles that must have fed off some sort of irrational behavior. Many observers think that monetary policy might have somehow fueled these bubble-like episodes in asset markets. These are important questions for monetary policy, and it is disturbing that the monetary policy models in use cannot even be used to pose these questions.</p>
<p>In this paper I focus on two particular, and related, deviations from the assumption that all agents have the same probability distribution and that they optimally process all information available up to some date <em>t</em>. I consider the implications of agents' being able to process information only at a limited rate, and the implications of agents' assuming differing probability distriubions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Central banks, which used to be so secretive, are communicating more and more these days about their monetary policy. This development has proceeded hand in glove with a burgeoning new scholarly literature on the subject. The empirical evidence, reviewed selectively here, suggests that communication can move financial markets, enhance the predictability of monetary policy decisions, and perhaps even help central banks achieve their goals. A number of theoretical drawbacks to greater communication are also reviewed here. None seems very important in practice. That said, no consensus has yet emerged regarding what constitutes "optimal" communication strategy - either in quantity or nature.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>The mid-1980s began a period that might, in retrospect, be seen as the golden age of monetary policy. Worldwide inflation rates, which had come down from the high levels reached in the 1970s, were at the lowest level seen in a long time. In the real economy, low and stable inflation went along with growth - at first, reasonable, and later, remarkable - and with reduced volatility. The term Goldilocks is sometimes used to describe this solid, sustainable situation - meaning that, like the porridge in the fairy tale, it was neither too hot nor too cold but just right. A number of fortunate circumstances contributed to the Goldilocks economy. Deregulation and globalisation, with their impact on competition and pricing power in goods and labour markets, are sometimes seen as major factors supporting the achievement and maintenance of low inflation (Rogoff (2003)).</p>
<p>With the weakening of deregulation and globalisation, will we see the end of the golden age, which then will turn out to have been only a short episode? On the one hand, an end to the golden age would be no surprise for those who have stressed from the outset that its highly positive macroeconomic outcomes were the result, if not of luck, then of benign circumstances whose combination could not be expected to last forever (Sims and Zha (2006)). And do not recent developments already confirm this sceptical assessment of the role of central banks and monetary policy during this period? Isn't inflation rising? Doesn't the ongoing turbulence in financial markets indicate that central banks did not - or, rather, could not - prevent such developments?</p>
<p>On the other hand, have we not seen the emergence of a policy regime that should be robust enough to continue the period of monetary stability? And would not a regime of monetary stability contribute to the stability of the real economy? We might only ex post be able to give a definite answer to these questions. For the time being, we can just study the emergence of the current policy regime and its elements via the practice of central banking and the results of research.</p>
<p>I would like to start with a personal note. It would be, to say the least, overambitious to survey in just a few pages roughly three decades of research on monetary policy. The same is true for the analysis of monetary policymaking during this period. What I have tried to do is simply provide the reflections of someone who, coming from academia, played a special role in two central banks - the Bundesbank (from 1990 to 1998) and the European Central Bank (from 1998 to 2006) - under extremely difficult circumstances, namely the aftermath of German reunification in 1990 and the launch of the European Union two years later. It was a challenge and a privilege to build the bridge between monetary policy research and monetary policymaking in those two central banks. What were the most relevant aspects of theory to be considered when deciding on monetary policy? How did it work in practice?</p>
<p>I will start with some results of monetary policy and the advances in research that, to a large degree, were triggered by those results. The later sections analyse the principles guiding the conduct of monetary policy by the Bundesbank and the ECB and some specific aspects of monetary policy. One of the main lessons I got during my 16 years of central banking practice is that it is critical to raise questions and not ignore important insights - even if the dominant approaches in research seem to suggest otherwise. It should therefore not come as a surprise that the paper ends with open questions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Since the mid-1990s, major Japanese banks have sold off a significant portion of their holdings of corporate equity. Using information on the identity of Japanese firms' top 10 shareholders, this paper explores the process of banks' equity disposal. There is some evidence that, after FY2001, banks' sales of equity accelerated, even holdings in firms for which the bank served as the main bank. However, affiliation with a main bank - proxied by firm-bank loan and shareholding ties - continues to be negatively associated with firm performance through FY2004. Regression estimates suggest that firms with strong bank ties are less profitable, face higher interest payments, and yet do not seem to enjoy lower stock price volatility than other firms. These effects are strongest for firms with a history of outside financing options, consistent with earlier arguments that the benefits of main bank relationships accrue to the banks themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Explaining exchange rates has long been an important but vexing issue in international economics and finance. In recent years, a number of studies have shown that investors' private information plays a central role in determining exchange rates. We demonstrate in this paper that the private information of investors relevant for exchange rates is largely connected to the stock market, and that this information is conveyed to foreign exchange (FX) markets by order flow that is induced by investors' transactions in the stock market. We establish these results by analyzing several novel unused datasets on nearly two years' worth of daily-frequency capital flows of nonresident investors in the foreign exchange, stock, and bond markets of Thailand. We present compelling evidence that FX order flow that is induced by nonresident investors transactions in the Stock Exchange of Thailand - which we show are driven largely by private information - has far greater explanatory power for the exchange rate than other order flow has, both in the short run and the long run. In contrast, FX order flow of nonresident investors that is related to their transactions in Thai government bonds - which we find are not driven appreciably by private information - does not have a statistically significant effect on the exchange rate.</p>

<p>This paper estimates the Balassa-Samuelson effects for 11 countries in central and eastern Europe on a disaggregated set of quarterly data covering the period from the mid-1990s to the first quarter of 2008. The Balassa-Samuelson effects are clearly present and explain around 24% of inflation differentials vis-à-vis the euro area (about 1.2 percentage points on average); and around 84% of domestic relative price differentials between non-tradables and tradables; or about 16% of total domestic inflation (about 1.1 percentage points on average). The paper presents mixed evidence on whether the Balassa-Samuelson effects have declined since 2001 compared with the second half of the 1990s.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Despite constituting the very heart of the monetary transmission mechanism, widespread misconceptions still exist regarding how monetary policy is implemented. This paper highlights the key misconceptions in this regard and shows how they have compromised the understanding of important aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism. In particular, the misplaced emphasis on open market operations as the means through which monetary policy is implemented can give rise to inappropriate characterizations of monetary policy, as well as to ill-defined discussions of liquidity effects, the bank lending channel, and sterilized exchange rate intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Few areas of monetary economics have been studied as extensively as the transmission mechanism. The literature on this topic has evolved substantially over the years, following the waxing and waning of conceptual frameworks and the changing characteristics of the financial system. In this paper, taking as a starting point a brief overview of the extant work on the interaction between capital regulation, the business cycle and the transmission mechanism, we offer some broader reflections on the characteristics of the transmission mechanism in light of the evolution of the financial system. We argue that insufficient attention has so far been paid to the link between monetary policy and the perception and pricing of risk by economic agents - what might be termed the "risk-taking channel" of monetary policy. We develop the concept, compare it with current views of the transmission mechanism, explore its mutually reinforcing link with "liquidity" and analyse its interaction with monetary policy reaction functions. We argue that changes in the financial system and prudential regulation may have increased the importance of the risk-taking channel and that prevailing macroeconomic paradigms and associated models are not well suited to capturing it, thereby also reducing their effectiveness as guides to monetary policy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper investigates the spillover effects of money market turbulence in 2007-08 on the short-term covered interest parity (CIP) condition between the US dollar and the euro through the foreign exchange (FX) swap market. Sharp and persistent deviations from the CIP condition observed during the turmoil are found to be significantly associated with differences in the counterparty risk between European and US financial institutions. Furthermore, evidence is found that dollar term funding auctions by the ECB, supported by dollar swap lines with the Federal Reserve, have stabilized the FX swap market by lowering the volatility of deviations from CIP.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Why do private firms stay private? Empirical evidence on this issue is sparse, as most private firms in the US do not report their financial results. We investigate why private status matters by taking advantage of a unique dataset of large, leveraged private firms with SEC filings. Unlike a number of other studies, we find that neither the existence of growth opportunities, nor the desire of firm founders to diversify, is a principal determinant of the decision whether or not to retain private status. Rather, the existence of private benefits of control appears to serve as the most significant incentive to stay private. Family-controlled firms have significantly lower probabilities of filing for an IPO, while a board structure that grants management relatively more autonomy lowers the probability of an IPO filing as well. Cross-sectional analysis of profitability and ex post performance suggests that while private benefits of control may encourage firms to stay private, they do not have detrimental effects on firm efficiency. In contrast, firms controlled by private equity specialists appear to place a low value on control benefits and are likely to go public as a means of cashing out.</p>

<p>Banks that enjoyed generous external financial support tended to under-price risk in the international syndicated loan market and did not show signs of innovation in their loan participations. Loans arranged by such banks had on average lower spreads (controlling for risk and other characteristics) and these banks retained loans that were on average priced below market. When supported banks’ investment strategy differed materially from that of the average bank it was in holding less specialised portfolios, in aligning more closely with market trends, and in exhibiting lower persistence in their sectoral allocations.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the relative role of price discovery between two long-term swap contracts that exchange U.S. dollars for Japanese yen - the cross-currency basis swap and the foreign exchange (FX) swap - using structural state space models. Our main findings are that: (i) the currency swap market plays a much more dominant role in price discovery than the FX swap market; and (ii) FX swap prices tend to under react to changes in the efficient price, while cross-currency swap prices react almost entirely to them.</p>

<p>The paper investigates the characteristics of house price dynamics and the role of institutional features in nine Asia-Pacific economies during 1993-2006. On average, house prices tend to be more volatile in markets with lower supply elasticity and a more flexible business environment. At the national level, the current run-up in house prices mainly reflects adjustment to improved fundamentals rather than speculative housing bubbles. However, evidence of bubbles does exist in some market segments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of Bank Indonesia's and Bank of Thailand's monetary policy communication. We focus on two channels of communication: monetary policy statements, and inter-meeting statements. Although the structure of Bank Indonesia's and Bank of Thailand's monetary policy statements have some differences, most of the statements contain policy inclination. In addition, during inter-meeting periods, members of their board of governors often convey statements that contain policy inclination. Our empirical results show that to some extent Bank Indonesia's and Bank of Thailand's monetary policy statements and inter-meeting statements move short-term interest rates effectively. We find that there is asymmetry in the effects of the statements, that is, the statements with loose policy inclination tend to be more effective relative to the statements with tight policy inclination.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In this paper we investigate whether cross-sectional information from local equity markets contained information on devaluation expectations during the Asian crisis. We concentrate on the information content of equity prices as these markets were in general the largest and most liquid at the time and, thus, presumably the best carriers of information. Using an event-study approach for the period leading up to each of the devaluations which occurred during the Asian crisis (namely those of Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand), we compare returns in the equity prices of exporting and non-exporting firms. This is based on the assumption that the expectation of a devaluation should help the stock of exporting firms outperform those of non-exporting firms. Overall we do find some evidence supporting this hypothesis, although at different degrees depending on the country. Our second finding is that local equity market prices, as reflected in the different patterns seen for exporters and non-exporters, did to at least to some extent price in the possibility that the Thai devaluation would be followed by other countries in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Hedge funds are major players in the international financial system and nimble investment strategies including the use of leverage allow them to build up large positions. Yet the monitoring of systemic risks posed by the build-up of leverage is hampered by incomplete information on hedge funds' balance sheet positions. This paper describes how an extension of "regression-based style analysis" and publicly available data on fund returns yield an indicator of the average amount of funding leverage used by hedge funds. The approach can take into account non-linear exposures through the use of synthetic option returns as possible risk factors. The resulting estimates of leverage are generally plausible for several hedge fund families, in particular those whose returns are well captured by the risk factors used in the estimation. In the absence of more detailed information on hedge fund investments, these estimates can serve as a tool for macro-prudential surveillance of financial system stability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The crisis enveloping global financial markets since August 2007 was triggered by actual and prospective credit losses on US mortgages. Was the United States just unlucky to have been the first to experience a housing crisis? Or was it inherently more susceptible to one? I examine the limited international evidence available, to ask how the boom-bust cycle in the US housing market differed from elsewhere and what the underlying institutional drivers of these differences were. Compared with other countries, the United States seems to have: built up a larger overhang of excess housing supply; experienced a greater easing in mortgage lending standards; and ended up with a household sector more vulnerable to falling housing prices. Some of these outcomes seem to have been driven by tax, legal and regulatory systems that encouraged households to increase their leverage and permitted lenders to enable that development. Given the institutional background, it may have been that the US housing boom was always more likely to end badly than the booms elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 15 years there has been remarkable progress in the specification and estimation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Central banks in developed and emerging market economies have become increasingly interested in their usefulness for policy analysis and forecasting. This paper reviews some issues and challenges surrounding the use of these models at central banks. It recognises that they offer coherent frameworks for structuring policy discussions. Nonetheless, they are not ready to accomplish all that is being asked of them. First, they still need to incorporate relevant transmission mechanisms or sectors of the economy; second, issues remain on how to empirically validate them; and finally, challenges remain on how to effectively communicate their features and implications to policy makers and to the public. Overall, at their current stage DSGE models have important limitations. How much of a problem this is will depend on their specific use at central banks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper identifies two types of market failures. The first concerns a coordination problem associated with panics. The problem in analysing this type of market failure from a policy perspective is that there is no widely accepted method for selecting equilibria. The second market failure concerns the incompleteness of financial markets. The essential problem here is that the incentives to provide liquidity lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. The paper outlines three manifestations of market failure associated with liquidity provision: financial fragility, contagion and asset price bubbles. The framework developed allows some insight into the question of when the financial system acts a shock absorber and when it acts as an amplifier. Having identified when there is a market failure, the paper looks at whether there are policies that can correct the undesirable effects of such failures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In a financial system where balance sheets are continuously marked to market, asset price changes show up immediately in changes in net worth, and elicit responses from financial intermediaries, who adjust the size of their balance sheets. We document evidence that marked to market leverage is strongly procyclical. Such behaviour has aggregate consequences. Changes in aggregate balance sheets for intermediaries forecast changes in risk appetite in financial markets, as measured by the innovations in the VIX index. Aggregate liquidity can be seen as the rate of change of the aggregate balance sheet of the financial intermediaries.</p>

<p>Banks and other lenders often transfer credit risk to liberate capital for further loan intermediation. This paper aims to explore the design, prevalence and effectiveness of credit risk transfer (CRT). The focus is on the costs and benefits for the efficiency and stability of the financial system. After an overview of recent credit risk transfer activity, the following points are discussed: motivations for CRT by banks; risk retention; theories of CDO design; specialty finance companies. As an illustration of CLO design, an example is provided showing how the credit quality of the borrowers can deteriorate if efforts to control their default risks are costly for issuers.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Confronted with a speculative attack on its currency peg, an authority weighs the short-term benefit of giving in and fine tuning the economy against the long-term benefit of credibility-enhancing resistance. In turn, speculators with heterogeneous beliefs face strategic uncertainty that peaks at the time of the attack, when the fate of the peg is unclear, and then declines, as the economy settles in a stable currency regime. In this environment, a less conservative authority - i.e. one that stabilises less the exchange rate once a peg is abandoned - may be more likely to withstand an attack on the peg. This result, which strengthens as speculators' risk aversion declines, casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that greater conservatism enhances welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The development of Asian foreign exchange markets has progressed appreciably in recent years. Data from the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey indicate that the turnover of Asian currencies rose sharply between 2004 and 2007, financial institutions became more important customers, and the participation of non-residents increased. Notwithstanding this progress, the liquidity of Asian foreign exchange markets continues to be undermined by foreign exchange controls. For Asian currencies other than HKD and SGD, non-residents account for a relatively small share of activity and FX swap markets are still in their infancy. Offshore non-deliverable markets have developed in response to controls, causing trading activity to fragment. Furthermore, Herstatt risk remains high in Asian foreign exchange markets. Almost all transactions between Asian currencies are executed via the US dollar so, for those trades not cleared through CLS Bank, each leg is settled at significantly different times.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The unfolding financial turmoil in mature economies has prompted the official and private sectors to reconsider policies, business models and risk management practices. Regardless of its future evolution, it already threatens to become one of the defining economic moments of the 21st century. This essay seeks to provide a preliminary assessment of the events and to draw some lessons for policies designed to strengthen the financial system on a long-term basis. It argues that the turmoil is best seen as a natural result of a prolonged period of generalised and aggressive risk-taking, which happened to have the subprime market at its epicentre. In other words, it represents the archetypal example of financial instability with potentially serious macroeconomic consequences that follows the build-up of financial imbalances in good times. The significant idiosyncratic elements, including the threat of an unprecedented involuntary "reintermediation" wave for banks and the dislocations associated with new credit risk transfer instruments, are arguably symptoms of more fundamental common causes. The policy response, while naturally taking into account the idiosyncratic weaknesses brought to light by the turmoil, should be firmly anchored to the more enduring factors that drive financial instability. This essay highlights possible mutually reinforcing steps in three areas: accounting, disclosure and risk management; the architecture of prudential regulation; and monetary policy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The remarkable stability of low domestic inflation in many countries requires explanation. In this paper, a number of competing hypotheses are evaluated on a stand-alone basis, and all are found to be inadequate. This includes the view that this outcome has been solely the result of more effective disinflationary monetary policies. However, a combination of these hypotheses (including a significant role for increased global competition) seems to provide a plausible explanation, not only for continuing low inflation, but also its coexistence with rapid growth and low real interest rates. Unfortunately, the analysis also leads to the conclusion that rising inflation, unwinding financial imbalances, or both, could easily follow the welcome stability seen to date.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Using two newly available ultrahigh-frequency datasets, we investigate empirically how frequently one can sample certain foreign exchange and U.S. Treasury security returns without contaminating estimates of their integrated volatility with market microstructure noise. We find that one can sample FX returns as frequently as once every 15 to 20 seconds without contaminating volatility estimates; bond returns may be sampled as frequently as once every 2 to 3 minutes on days without U.S. macroeconomic announcements, and as frequently as once every 40 seconds on announcement days. With a simple realized kernel estimator, the sampling frequencies can be increased to once every 2 to 5 seconds for FX returns and to about once every 30 to 40 seconds for bond returns. These sampling frequencies, especially in the case of FX returns, are much higher than those often recommended in the empirical literature on realized volatility in equity markets.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We examine the informational content of TIPS yields from the viewpoint of a general 3-factor no-arbitrage term structure model of inflation and interest rates. Our empirical results indicate that TIPS yields contained a "liquidity premium" that was until recently quite large (~1%). Key features of this premium are difficult to account for in a rational pricing framework, suggesting that TIPS may not have been priced efficiently in its early years. Besides the liquidity premium, a time-varying inflation risk premium complicates the interpretation of the TIPS breakeven inflation rate (the difference between the nominal and TIPS yields). Nonetheless, high-frequency variation in the TIPS breakeven rates is similar to the variation in inflation expectations implied by the model, lending support to the view that TIPS breakeven inflation rates are a useful proxy for inflation expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper uses an open economy DSGE model with a commodity sector and nominal and real rigidities to ask what factors account for current account developments in two small commodity exporting countries. We estimate the model, using Bayesian techniques, on Chilean and on New Zealand data, and investigate the structural factors that explain the behaviour of the two countries' current accounts. We find that foreign financial conditions, investment-specific shocks, and foreign demand account for the bulk of the variation of the current accounts of the two countries. In the case of New Zealand fluctuations in commodity export prices have also been important. Monetary and fiscal policy shocks (deviations from policy rules) are estimated to have relatively small effects on the current account.We find interesting differences in Chilean and New Zealand responses to some shocks, despite similarities between the two economies and the common structural model employed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Central bank communication has changed dramatically over the past decade, with some central banks providing guidance about or explicit forecasts of likely future policy rates. One frequently made argument against the provision by central banks of such guidance or forecasts is that it runs the risk of impairing market functioning. In this paper, we evaluate the behaviour of financial markets in the United States, the euro area and New Zealand in light of the communication strategies of central banks, in order to assess whether the provision of policy rate guidance by central banks impairs market functioning. While we find evidence that central bank policy rate forecasts influence market prices in New Zealand, we find no evidence that such guidance or forecasts impair market functioning in the United States, the euro area or New Zealand. The results suggest that the risk of impairing market functioning is not a strong argument against central banks' provision of policy rate guidance or forecasts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper examines from various angles foreign investors' daily transactions in six emerging Asian equity markets and their relationship with local market returns and exchange rate changes over the period 1999-2006. Confirming much of the literature, we find that equity market returns matter for net equity purchases, and vice versa. In addition, we find that while currency returns tend to show little influence over foreign investors' demand for Asian equities, net equity purchases do have some explanatory power over near-term exchange rate changes. Moreover, we find that foreign investors do quite often move in or out of multiple Asian markets simultaneously - but more so on the way in than on the way out. Nonetheless, during specific events of heightened market volatility, we observe some interesting deviations from the full-sample average relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper illustrates various applications of the BIS international banking statistics. We first compare international bank flows to measures of real activity and liquidity and show that the international banking system is becoming a more important conduit for the transfer of capital across countries. We then use network analysis tools to construct a bird's eye view of the structure of the international banking market and to identify key financial hubs. Linking this information with balance of payments statistics helps to better understand the role of banks in the financing of current account flows, for example the recycling of petrodollars and Asian surpluses. Finally, the paper illustrates how the BIS statistics can be used to analyse internationally active banks' foreign exposures to credit risk and, thus, spot vulnerabilities in the international banking market.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Do housing and equity booms significantly raise the probability of extremely bad outcomes at the margin? This study addresses this question for a group of 8 East Asian countries. The main findings are the following: (i) Asset price booms in housing and equity markets, either separately or jointly but especially in housing, significantly raise the probability at the margin that (a) the real output gap will be in the left tail of its distribution, in which output is significantly below trend, and (b) the price-level gap will be in the right tail of its distribution, in which the price level is significantly above trend. At the margin, the risk of the occurrence of these particular tail events due to asset price booms is largely asymmetric and does not apply to the tails of good outcomes; and (ii) Expected real output and price level outcomes that are either obtained without conditioning on asset price booms or are obtained conditional on asset price booms using the normal approximation underestimate the risk of tail events and lead to less pessimistic but misleading inferences. One implication for monetary policy is that an approach that is ex-ante more compatible with risk management may be appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In the economic environment that has been emerging over the last couple of decades, it is more likely that the occasional build-up of financial imbalances, typically in the form of unsustainable credit and asset price booms, will occur against the background of low and stable inflation, posing a potential threat to financial and macroeconomic stability. This means that the scope for monetary policy to lean against the build-up may be more constrained than in the past, when those imbalances would normally develop alongside rising inflation. This puts a premium on a strengthening of the macroprudential orientation of prudential frameworks, designed to restrain the build up of the imbalances and to make the financial system better able to withstand their unwinding. In this paper, we review the progress made in this direction in recent years. We conclude that there is now a much keener awareness of the importance of a macroprudential orientation but that progress in making it operational, while considerable, has been slower. The main obstacles are of an analytical and, above all, institutional/political economy nature. We suggest ways in which these obstacles could be addressed and underline the potential complementary role that adjustments in monetary policy frameworks could play.</p>

<p> This paper discusses various challenges in the specification and implementation of "macro-finance" models in which macroeconomic variables and term structure variables are modeled together in a no-arbitrage framework. I classify macro-finance models into pure latent-factor models ("internal basis models") and models which have observed macroeconomic variables as state variables ("external basis models"), and examine the underlying assumptions behind these models. Particular attention is paid to the issue of unspanned short-run fluctuations in macro variables and their potentially adverse effect on the specification of external basis models. I also discuss the challenge of addressing features like structural breaks and time-varying inflation uncertainty. Empirical difficulties in the estimation and evaluation of macro-finance models are also discussed in detail.</p>

<p> This paper reexamines the issue of unspanned stochastic volatility (USV) in bond markets and the puzzle of poor relative pricing between bonds and bond options. I make a distinction between the "weak USV" and the "strong USV" scenarios, and analyze the evidence for each of them. I argue that the poor bonds/options relative pricing in the extant literature is not necessarily evidence for the strong USV scenario, and show that a maximally flexible 2-factor quadratic-Gaussian model (a non-USV model) estimated without bond options data can capture much of the movement in bond option prices. Dropping the positive-definiteness requirement for nominal interest rates and adopting "regularized" estimations turn out to be important for obtaining sensible results.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b> </p>
<p> This study examines bank risk by investigating the equity and loan portfolio characteristics of publicly-traded bank holding companies. Unlike the pattern for non-financial firms, equity betas of large banks are two to five times greater than those of small banks. In explaining this, we note that regulation imposes an effective cap on banks' equity volatility. Because the portfolios of small banks are less diversified, this cap has a greater effect on small banks than large banks. But we reject the hypothesis that small banks lower their equity volatility through lower leverage. Instead, we find that the reduced ability of small banks to diversify forces them to either pick borrowers whose assets have relatively low credit risk or make loans that are backed by relatively more collateral. </p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Over the past three decades, the financial system has been going through a historical phase of major structural change. This paper traces the implications of this financial revolution for the dynamics of financial distress and for policy. It argues that, despite this revolution, some fundamental characteristics of the financial system have not changed and that these hold the key to the dynamics of financial instability. These characteristics relate to imperfect information in financial contracts, to risk perceptions and incentives, and to powerful feedback mechanisms operating both within the financial system and between that system and the macro-economy. As a result, the primary cause of financial instability has always been, and will continue to be, overextension in risk-taking and balance-sheets. The challenge is to design a policy response that is firmly anchored to the more enduring features of financial instability while at the same time tailoring it to the evolving financial system. Using an analogy with road safety, policy has so far largely focused quite effectively on improving the state of the roads and on introducing buffers. More attention, however, could usefully be devoted to the design and implementation of speed limit.</p>

<p> We propose that individual banks' reported loan losses and provisions for future loan losses are lower, all else equal (including their own financial statements), when the banking industry is weaker. We further hypothesize that this option of underreporting charge-offs and provisions provides banks with incentives, when the banking industry is weaker, to cluster more, or to seek "safety in similarity." </p>
<p> We provide evidence that large, individual U.S. banks indeed tend to report both lower charge-offs and lower provisions for loan losses, after controlling for their other determinants, when the banking industry is weaker. We also show that banks tend to be more clustered, or similar, when the industry is weaker. In addition, individual banks change their risk-taking to make it more similar to that of banking industry averages, and change it faster, when the industry is weaker. At the same time, in contrast to banks, we show that non-bank financial corporations show virtually no tendency to cluster more as their part of the financial sector weakens.<br/> </p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p> Researchers at central banks increasingly turn to counterfactual simulations to estimate the danger of contagion owing to exposures in the interbank loan market. The present paper summarises the findings of such simulations, provides a critical assessment of the modelling assumptions on which they are based, and discusses their use in financial stability analysis. On the whole, such simulations suggest that contagious defaults are unlikely, but cannot be fully ruled out, at least in some countries. If contagion does take place, then it could lead to the breakdown of a substantial fraction of the banking system, thus imposing high costs to society. However, when interpreting these results, one has to bear in mind the potential bias caused by the very strong assumptions underlying the simulations. While robustness tests indicate that the models might be able to correctly predict whether or not contagion could be an issue and, possibly, also identify critical institutions, they are less suited for stress testing or for the analysis of policy options in crises, primarily due to their lack of behavioural foundations. Going forward, more work is needed on how to attach probabilities to the individual scenarios and on the microfoundations of the models.<br/> </p>

<p>The paper argues that China's capital controls remain substantially binding. This has allowed the Chinese authorities to retain some degree of short-term monetary autonomy, despite the fixed exchange rate up to July 2005. Although the Chinese capital controls have not been watertight, we find sustained and significant gaps between onshore and offshore renminbi interest rates and persistent dollar/renminbi interest rate differentials during the period of a de facto dollar peg. While some cross-border flows do respond to market expectations and relative yields, they have not been large enough to equalise onshore and offshore renminbi yields.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p> This paper develops a stochastic dynamic model to examine the impact of capital regulation on banks' financial decisions. In equilibrium, lending decisions, capital buffer and the probability of bank failure are endogenously determined. Compared to a flat-rate capital rule, a risk-sensitive capital standard causes the capital requirement to be much higher for small (and riskier) banks and much lower for large (and less risky) banks. Nevertheless, changes in actual capital holdings are less pronounced due to the offsetting effect of capital buffers. Moreover, the non-binding capital constraint in equilibrium implies that banks adopt an active portfolio strategy and hence the counter-cyclical movement of risk-based capital requirements does not necessarily lead to a reinforcement of the credit cycle. In fact, the results from the calibrated model show that the impact on cyclical lending behavior differs substantially across banks. Lastly, the analysis suggests that the adoption of a more risk-sensitive capital regime can be welfare-improving from a regulator's perspective, in that it causes less distortion in loan decisions and achieves a better balance between safety and efficiency.<br/> </p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p> Profits growth has been strong in many developed economies in recent years, and the profit share – the share of factor income going to capital – has been high compared with historical experience. This paper shows that, rather than being a recent phenomenon, profit shares have trended upwards since about the mid 1980s in most developed economies for which comparable data are available. There are a number of possible explanations for this, but not all of them are consistent with a global trend over two decades, nor do they fit cross-country differences in the trend in the profit share. </p>
<p> The preferred explanation advanced in this paper is that ongoing technological progress has increased the rate of obsolescence of capital goods. This induces a greater rate of churn in both capital and jobs, which puts firms in a stronger bargaining position relative to a labour force that now faces more frequent job losses on average. Firms can therefore reap a larger fraction of the economic surplus created by market frictions, which raises the measured profit share. This effect is stronger where labour market institutions are more rigid, consistent with the cross-country pattern in the trends in the profit share. There is also a positive relationship between the size of the trend in the profit share, and the extent of product market regulation. This suggests a role for competition and innovation in driving down high profit margins. These explanations appear to fit the data better than alternatives raised in the literature.<br/> </p>

When applied to large simulated portfolios with realistic characteristics, this procedure reveals that violations of key assumptions of the well-known Asymptotic Single-Risk Factor (ASRF) model are virtually inconsequential. By contrast, flaws in the calibrated interdependence of credit risk across exposures, which are driven by plausible small-sample estimation errors or popular rule-of-thumb values of asset return correlations, can lead to significant inaccuracies in measures of portfolio credit risk. Similar inaccuracies arise under erroneous, albeit standard, assumptions regarding the tails of the distribution of asset returns.<br/> </p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper estimates the size and dynamics of inflation risk premia in the euro area, based on a joint model of macroeconomic and term structure dynamics. Information from both nominal and index-linked yields is used in the empirical analysis. Our results indicate that term premia in the euro area yield curve reflect predominantly real risks, i.e. risks which affect the returns on both nominal and index-linked bonds. On average, inflation risk premia were negligible during the EMU period but occasionally subject to statistically signifcant fluctuations in 2004-2006. Movements in the raw break-even rate appear to have mostly reflected such variations in inflation risk premia, while long-term inflation expectations have remained remarkably anchored from 1999 to date.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>There has been mounting evidence that the inflation process has been changing. Inflation is now much lower and much more stable around the globe. And its sensitivity to measures of economic slack and increases in input costs appears to have declined. Probably the most widely supported explanation for this phenomenon is that monetary policy has been much more effective. There is no doubt in our mind that this explanation goes a long way towards explaining the better inflation performance we have observed. In this paper, however, we begin to explore a complementary, rather than alternative, explanation. We argue that prevailing models of inflation are too "country-centric", in the sense that they fail to take sufficient account of the role of global factors in influencing the inflation process. The relevance of a more "globe-centric" approach is likely to have increased as the process of integration of the world economy has gathered momentum, a process commonly referred to as "globalisation". In a large cross-section of countries, we find some rather striking prima facie evidence that this has indeed been the case. In particular, proxies for global economic slack add considerable explanatory power to traditional benchmark inflation rate equations, even allowing for the influence of traditional indicators of external influences on domestic inflation, such as import and oil prices. Moreover, the role of such global factors has been growing over time, especially since the 1990s. And in a number of cases, global factors appear to have supplanted the role of domestic measures of economic slack.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Using panel data for a large number of countries, we find that economic contractions are not followed by offsetting fast recoveries. Trend output lost is not regained, on average. Wars, crises, and other negative shocks lead to absolute divergence and lower long-run growth, whereas we find absolute convergence in expansions. The output costs of political and financial crises are permanent on average, and long-term growth is negatively linked to volatility. These results also imply that panel data studies can help identify the sources of growth and that economic models should be capable of explaining growth and fluctuations within the same framework.<br/> </p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper examines the behaviour of exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices in India during the post-economic reforms initiated since the major devaluation of July 1991. It observes that there is no clear-cut evidence of a fall in exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices. Further, there is asymmetry in pass-through between appreciation and depreciation, and between sizes of the exchange rate change. Based on the empirical evidence provided in the literature, the paper conjectures that reductions in import tariffs, the removal of trade restrictions, the increased import penetration ratio and openness of the economy and the change in the composition of imports following the economic liberalisation could have transitorily negated the impact of lower inflation on pass-through. Part of the non-decline in long-run pass-through is due to a rise in inflation persistence. This could follow from the dismantling of price controls in an environment of periodic spurts in inflation around a non-declining inflationary trend, combined with a rise in the government deficit, which has a nexus with inflation in India.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>The paper analyses the information content of trades in Bund futures and German government bonds before and during the 1998 financial market turbulences and tests whether the contributions to price discovery of the two market segments were constant over time. The results suggest that, under the normal market conditions prevailing in the first half of the year, between 19% and 33% of the variation in the efficient price was due to trading in the spot market. In the aftermath of the recapitalisation of LTCM, by contrast, the bond market's share in price discovery dropped to zero, with information becoming incorporated into prices only in the futures market. This decline can be traced to an unusually high proportion of large client trades that were executed against dealer inventory, which suggests that they were primarily motivated by liquidity rather than by information. On the methodological side, the paper computes information shares and factor weights based on the Gonzalo-Granger decomposition in markets with different trading frequencies. In addition, the paper captures variations over time by using a sequence of break point tests.<br/><br/> </p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Despite a significant deterioration in the US net foreign asset position, there has not been a corresponding deterioration in the net income balance. In fact, there has generally been a net income surplus. Two factors have been particularly important for the positive net income balance over the past 15 years or so. The first is that the United States has a positive net external equity balance and a negative net external debt balance. This contributes to a net income surplus because the income yield on equity has been higher than the income yield on debt.<br/> The second factor is that the United States earns a persistently higher income yield on its foreign direct investment (FDI) assets than foreigners earn on their direct investments in the United States. This paper summarises the evidence from firm-level studies and time-series data for the United States, as well as cross-country comparisons, to weigh up alternative explanations for this outcome. The evidence presented suggests that differences in income yields on FDI are not explained by the presence of large stocks of unmeasured assets. Moreover, they do not appear to be related to different characteristics of the investment such as industry composition or riskiness. There is some evidence that differences in the average maturity of investment have had some effect on yield differentials, especially in the 1980s. There are also incentives to minimise taxes that are consistent with the relatively low income yields earned on FDI in the United States, but no firm evidence that this is an important explanation.<br/> </p>

<p>Three of the most important recent facts in global macroeconomics – the sustained rise in the US current account deficit, the stubborn decline in long run real rates, and the rise in the share of US assets in global portfolio – appear as anomalies from the perspective of conventional wisdom and models. Instead, in this paper we provide a model that rationalizes these facts as an equilibrium outcome of two observed forces: a) potential growth differentials among different regions of the world and, b) hetero- geneity in these regions' capacity to generate financial assets from real investments. In extensions of the basic model, we also generate exchange rate and FDI excess returns which are broadly consistent with the recent trends in these variables. More generally, the framework is flexible enough to shed light on a range of scenarios in a global equilibrium environment.<br/><br/> (This paper includes comments by Jeffrey Frankel and Michael Mussa.)</p>

<p>Using a sample of emerging markets that are integrated into global bond markets, we analyse the collapse and recovery phase of output collapses that coincide with systemic sudden stops, defined as periods of skyrocketing aggregate bond spreads and large capital flow reversals. Our findings indicate the presence of a very similar pattern across different episodes: output recovers with virtually no recovery in either domestic or foreign credit, a phenomenon that we call Phoenix Miracle, where output "rises from its ashes", suggesting that firms go through a process of financial engineering to restore liquidity outside the formal credit markets. Moreover, we show that the US Great Depression could be catalogued as a Phoenix Miracle. However, in contrast to the US Great Depression, EM output collapses occur in a context of accelerating price inflation and falling real wages, casting doubts on price deflation and nominal wage rigidity as key elements in explaining output collapse, and suggesting that financial factors are prominent for understanding these collapses.<br/><br/> (This paper includes comments by Takatoshi Ito.)</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Despite the disappearance of formal barriers to international investment across countries, we find that the average home bias of US investors towards the 46 countries with the largest equity markets did not fall from 1994 to 2004 when countries are equally weighted but fell when countries are weighted by market capitalisation. This evidence is inconsistent with portfolio theory explanations of the home bias, but is consistent with what we call the optimal insider ownership theory of the home bias. Since foreign investors can only own shares not held by insiders, there will be a large home bias towards countries in which insiders own large stakes in corporations. Consequently, for the home bias to fall substantially, insider ownership has to fall in countries where it is high. Poor governance leads to concentrated insider ownership, so that governance improvements make it possible for corporate ownership to become more dispersed and for the home bias to fall. We find that the home bias of US investors decreased the most towards countries in which the ownership by corporate insiders is low and countries in which ownership by corporate insiders fell. Using firm-level data for Korea, we find that portfolio equity investment by foreign investors in Korean firms is inversely related to insider ownership and that the firms that attract the most foreign portfolio equity investment are large firms with dispersed ownership.<br/><br/> (This paper includes comments by Philip Lane.)</p>

<p>The relationship between democracy and globalisation has been the focus of substantial policy and academic debate. Some argue that democracy and globalisation go hand in hand suggesting that unrestricted international transactions leads to increased political accountability and transparency. And, politically free societies are likely to have minimal restrictions on the mobility of goods and services across national borders. Others argue that the causal relationship should be reversed: democracies are more likely to have closed markets and vice versa. We examine these relationships between political democracy and trade and financial globalisation over the period 1870-2000 and treat both democracy and globalisation as both cause and effect. Our empirical strategy uses instrumental variables and estimates relationships using the Generalised Method of Moments framework. Our general findings support the hypothesis of a positive two-way relationship between democracy and globalisation.<br/><br/> (This paper includes comments by Harold James and Marc Flandreau.)</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Well developed financial markets are a necessary condition for a currency to play a role as a reserve currency. The introduction of the euro greatly improved the functioning of euro financial markets. This paper investigates whether euro financial markets have developed sufficiently to facilitate the emergence of the euro as a reserve currency on par with the US dollar. We find that the liquidity and breadth of euro financial markets are fast approaching those of dollar markets, and as a result the euro is eroding some of the advantages that have historically supported the pre-eminence of the US dollar as a reserve currency. This strengthens the incentive for monetary authorities to reconsider the currency composition of their reserves. Nevertheless, the introduction of the euro has not yet resulted in a significant change in the currency composition of official reserve holdings. The US dollar has maintained its place as the dominant reserve currency, supported perhaps by the edge that dollar financial markets still have over euro markets in terms of size, credit quality and liquidity, as well as inertia in the use of international currencies.</p>

<p>Discussion of exchange rate policy in Asia would benefit from appropriate measures of exchange rates on a multilateral basis. The purpose of this paper is to refine the construction of the effective exchange rates (EERs) for Asian economies, to make allowances for the role of Hong Kong SAR as an entrepôt and to reflect the fast-growing intra-regional trade. For the scenarios under consideration, it turns out that adjusting for re-export trade through Hong Kong SAR is generally more important in the determination of trade weights than updating the base year. The proposed refinements have important policy implications, particularly in estimating the relative sizes of currency blocs, should the region's exchange rate policies become more oriented to trade baskets than to bilateral dollar rates.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to find a period in the post-war era in which inflation-adjusted interest rates have been so low for so long and monetary and credit aggregates have expanded so much without igniting inflation (the "Great Liquidity Expansion puzzle"). What lies behind these developments? How benign are they? This paper argues that financial liberalisation, the establishment of credible anti-inflation monetary policies and (real-side) globalisation have resulted in subtle but profound changes in the dynamics of the economy and in the challenges faced by policymakers. In the new environment which has gradually been taking shape, the main "structural" risk may not be so much run away inflation. Rather, it may be the damage caused by the unwinding of financial imbalances that occasionally build up over the longer expansion phases of the economy, typically spanning more than one higher-frequency business cycle. Depending on its intensity, the unwinding can lead to economic weakness, unwelcome disinflation and possibly financial strains. The analysis has implications for monetary and prudential policies. It calls for a firmer long-term focus, for greater symmetry in policy responses between upswings and downswings, with more attention being paid to actions during upswings, and for closer cooperation between monetary and prudential authorities. In recent years, the intellectual climate and policy frameworks have gradually evolved in a direction more consistent with this perspective. At the same time, obstacles to further progress remain. They are of an analytical, institutional and, above all, political economy nature. Removing them calls for further analytical and educational efforts.</p>

<p>This paper estimates a new open economy macroeconomic model for South Korea to determine the output effect of currency devaluations. Three transmission mechanisms are considered: the expenditure-switching, the balance sheet, and a monetary channel associated to a nominal exchange rate target. Devaluations are defined as an increase in this target. This allows to isolate the effects of an explicit exogenous devaluationary policy shock. Ceteris paribus, a devaluation is found to be expansionary. Output contractions in South Korea should then be associated with a different shock such as an adverse shock on the international interest rate or on export demand.</p>

<p>Equity and credit-default-swap (CDS) markets are in disagreement as to the extent to which asset returns co-move across firms. This suggests market segmentation and casts ambiguity about the asset-return correlations underpinning observed prices of portfolio credit risk. The ambiguity could be eliminated by - currently unavailable - data that reveal the market valuation of low-probability/large-impact events. At present, judicious assumptions about this valuation can be used to reconcile observed prices with asset-return correlations implied by either equity or CDS markets. These conclusions are based on an analysis of tranche spreads of a popular CDS index, which incorporate a rather small premium for correlation risk.</p>

<p>Advances in risk measurement technology have reshaped financial markets and the functioning of the financial system. More recently, they have been reshaping the prudential framework. Looking forward, they have the potential to reshape financial reporting too. Recent initiatives to improve financial reporting standards have brought to the fore significant differences in perspective between accounting standard setters and prudential authorities. Building on previous work, we argue that risk measurement and management technology can be instrumental in bridging this gap and, by the same token, in improving financial reporting. Risk measurement plays a crucial role in the measurement, verification and validation of valuations. It is the basis for giving more prominence to risk and measurement error information in public disclosures. And it could act as more of a focal point in the design of accounting standards, as greater consistency between sound risk management practices and accounting standards can help to narrow the wedge between accounting and underlying economic valuations.</p>

Assessing financial claims in a system context captures features that are missing in a partial equilibrium setting.

Conversely, it is possible that de-leveraging leads to increases in spreads, as is often observed during crises.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This study examines whether accounting changes result in changes in the economic behaviour of financial institutions. The results of several papers examining how banks respond to accounting changes that affect their regulatory capital ratios are consistent with Furfine's (2000) summary that "capital regulation, broadly speaking, can significantly influence bank decision-making." These papers do not attempt to disentangle the effects of capital regulation versus market discipline. This paper examines banks' response to recent changes in accounting for Trust Preferred Securities that effect how these securities are reported in the balance sheet but do not change the calculation of Tier 1 capital. This provides a good setting to examine whether accounting changes induce changes in banks' economic behaviour in the absence of an effect on regulatory capital. I test five hypotheses related to banks' decisions to issue Trust Preferred Stock during the period from 1997 through 2004. Specifically, I examine whether there was an overall decrease in banks' propensity to issue these securities after the accounting change, whether publicly traded banks and those that access the external debt markets were more likely to issue these securities before the accounting change but not after, and whether banks with low regulatory capital ratios and with high marginal tax rates were more likely to issue these securities both before and after the accounting change. The results suggest that accounting changes can lead to changes in banks' economic behaviour even when the change in accounting does not affect regulatory capital calculations. This is consistent with bank managers acting as if they are concerned with the markets' response to the numbers reported after the accounting change.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The introduction of a new accounting standard for financial instruments, has raised a number of issues related to the application of fair value principles. This paper discusses some of these issues which are generally related to the fact that "fair values" are not always easily defined or readily available. It concludes that the application of fair value for financial liabilities might present fewer complications if it is matched by similar valuation principles for financial assets. The issue of measurement error is more complicated as it can be related to whether valuations refer to exit value, as postulated by the IASB, or deprival value, which is more closely related to firm-specific valuation. Measurement error is magnified in the income statement and so will be any biases from the application of historical accounting for derivatives. Despite any measurement issues, the problem of institution-specific dimensions of value that looms so large in the case of non-financial enterprises and makes the systematic application of fair value accounting fraud with difficulty there, would seem to be much more manageable for financial institutions because of their familiarity with risk measurement and management techniques for financial instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>I identify issues that bank regulators need to consider if fair value accounting is used for determining bank regulatory capital and when making regulatory decisions. In financial reporting, US and international accounting standard setters have issued several disclosure and measurement and recognition standards for financial instruments and all indications are that both standard setters will mandate recognition of all financial instruments at fair value. To help identify important issues for bank regulators, I briefly review capital market studies that examine the usefulness of fair value accounting to investors, and discuss marking-to-market implementation issues of determining financial instruments' fair values. In doing so, I identify several key issues. First, regulators need to consider how to let managers reveal private information in their fair value estimates while minimising strategic manipulation of model inputs to manage income and regulatory capital. Second, regulators need to consider how best to minimise measurement error in fair values to maximise their usefulness to investors and creditors when making investment decisions, and to ensure bank managers have incentives to select investments that maximise economic efficiency of the banking system. Third, cross-country institutional differences are likely to play an important role in determining the effectiveness of using mark-to-market accounting for financial reporting and bank regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper explains why the question is how, not if, today's financial statements should include estimates of the future. Including such estimates is not new, but their use is increasing. This increase results primarily because standard setters believe asset and liability measures that reflect current economic conditions and up-to-date expectations of the future will result in more useful information for making economic decisions, which is the objective of financial reporting. This is why standard setters seem focused on fair value accounting. How estimates of the future are incorporated in financial statements depends on the asset and liability measurement attribute, and on financial reporting definitions of assets and liabilities. The present definitions depend on identifying past transactions or events that give rise to expected inflows or outflows of economic benefits and, for inflows, control over the expected benefits. Thus, not all expected inflows or outflows of economic benefits are recognised. Note disclosures can help users understand recognised estimates, and can provide information about unrecognised estimates. Including more estimates of the future in today's financial statements would result in an income measure that differs from today's income, but arguably provides better information for making economic decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Credit rating agencies make multiple announcements, some of which are intended to reflect the latest information available about a firm and others of which are intended to provide a stable signal of credit quality. Using data on CDS spreads, we examine which of these different types of rating announcements contains pricingrelevant information. We find that all types, including changes in outlook, have a significant impact on CDS spreads. Even rating announcements preceded by similar announcements have an impact. The price impact is greatest for firms with split ratings, smallcap firms and firms rated near the threshold of investment grade.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) prescribes prompt and deterministic termination of banks with insufficient levels of book-value capital. This paper investigates whether reliance on book-value capital is a good policy choice and if PCA is an optimal regulatory approach. I use a variant of DeMarzo and Fishman's (2004) dynamic model of entrepreneurial finance to model interactions between a banker and a regulator. Under hidden choice of risk, private information on returns, limited commitment by the banker and costly liquidation, I first characterize the optimal incentive-feasible allocation, and then demonstrate that the optimal allocation is implementable through the combination of a risk-based deposit insurance premium and a book-value capital regulation with prompt and stochastic termination/bailout rather than deterministic termination with no bailout as in PCA. I also show that partial termination can be used instead of stochastic termination.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>No one in the industrial countries should now question the substantial economic benefits associated with reducing inflation from earlier, high levels. At the same time, history also teaches that the stability of consumer prices might not be sufficient to ensure macroeconomic stability. Past experience is replete with examples of major economic and financial crises that were not preceded by inflationary pressures. Conversely, history shows that many periods of deflation, based on rising productivity, were simultaneously characterised by rapid growth. Recent structural changes in the global economy imply that this history might have more contemporaneous relevance than is commonly thought. If so, the implication is that policies directed to the pursuit of price stability might have to be applied more flexibly and with a longer-run focus than has recently been the case.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper studies the relationship between macroeconomic behaviour and the monetary policy regime in Hong Kong and Singapore, using data for 1984-2004. We estimate an econometric model, comprising a Phillips curve, an IS curve and an equation for changes in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), which, in the case of Singapore, can be interpreted as a policy reaction function. The parameter estimates differ in two regards: the NEER responds to inflation in Singapore but not in Hong Kong, and the autoregressive parameter for the output gap in Singapore is smaller than in Hong Kong. Overall, the variability of inflation has been lower in Singapore, but the volatility of real economic activity has been similar in the two economies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We estimate arbitrage-free term structure models of US Treasury yields and spreads on BBB and Brated corporate bonds in a doubly-stochastic intensity-based framework. A novel feature of our analysis is the inclusion of macroeconomic variables - indicators of real activity, inflation and financial conditions - as well as latent factors, as drivers of term structure dynamics. Our results point to three key roles played by macro factors in the term structure of spreads: they have a significant impact on the level, and particularly the slope, of the curves; they are largely responsible for variation in the prices of systematic risk; and speculative grade spreads exhibit greater sensitivity to macro shocks than high grade spreads.</p>
<p>In addition to estimating risk-neutral default intensities, we provide estimates of physical default intensities using data on Moody's KMV EDFs™ as a forward-looking proxy for default risk. We find that the real and financial activity indicators, along with filtered estimates of the latent factors from our term structure model, explain a large portion of the variation in EDFs™ across time. Furthermore, measures of the price of default event risk implied by estimates of physical and risk-neutral intensities indicate that compensation for default event risk is countercyclical, varies widely across the cycle, and is higher on average and more variable for higher-rated bonds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper estimates exchange rate pass-through of six major industrial countries using a time-varying parameter with stochastic volatility model. Exchange rate pass-through is divided into impacts of exchange rate fluctuations to import prices (first-stage pass-through) and those of import price movements to consumer prices (second-stage pass-through). The paper finds that both stages of pass-through have declined over time for all the sample countries. The decline in second-stage pass-through is associated with the emergence of the low and stable inflation environment as well as a rise in import penetration, while the relationship to the inflation environment is weak for first-stage pass-through.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>This paper explores the evolving relationship between central banks and governments in the European monetary unification process. In particular, it focuses on the institution-building phase (setting up of the ECB) and the monetary and macro-economic policy mix within EMU. I attribute the undeniable success of the institution-building phase to an exceptional convergence of favourable facts and influences. Most importantly: the strong political commitment of the governments concerned; the trust placed in central bank experts in preparing the Maastricht Treaty; the incremental momentum resulting from the tight timetable; and, last but not least, the prevailing macro-economic conditions. As for the monetary and macro-economic policy mix, it is argued that in the run-up to achieving EMU the convergence criteria spelled out by the Maastricht Treaty proved a very effective tool in aligning national policies and in consolidating central bank independence (which became, in fact, the "sixth" convergence criterion, conditioning access to EMU). However, since the late 1990s, this delicate balance seems to have become rather less secure for mainly three reasons: the weakening restraint of politicians with regards to monetary policymaking; the worsening performance of the economy in the euro area; and the fact that economic union continues to lag monetary union, particularly with respect to micro or supply side reforms.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Central bank cooperation depends on a few crucial parameters: the extent to which central bankers agree on theory (end means relationships); the extent to which they can agree on goals (social purpose); the capacity (technical and institutional) to achieve their collective goals; and whether the broader political environment facilitates or impedes cooperation. This article explores these questions by first providing an overview of central banks and bankers. Among the G-10 countries, central bankers are likely to share political independence, relatively long term horizons, and (increasingly) academic backgrounds. These conditions may be conducive to high levels of cooperation in the future. Second, I explore the "easiest" form of cooperation – information sharing – and conclude that this is an area in which central bank cooperation will become increasingly routinised. Cooperation to address global financial stability is a more difficult cooperative dilemma, with tensions between the need for efficient regulatory management and the inclusion of a broader range of cooperating institutions. In the area of exchange rate and monetary policy coordination, consensus among the major exchange rate authorities regarding the effectiveness of coordinated exchange market interventions has withered, though this does not preclude a new consensus from emerging in the future. One of the most significant challenges to central bank cooperation in the future will be how to include rising monetary and financial powers, particularly China, into the cooperative management of international monetary conditions.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>The objective of this paper is to provide a balanced assessment of international cooperation among financial regulators, with a focus on banking supervision. While recognizing the undeniable – and even unexpected – achievements of these regulators in building a cooperative framework for financial supervision, we also suggest that this remains a work in progress, given the contemporary financial risk environment. Briefly, we argue that this environment – to the extent we understand it, for it remains opaque in important respects – has an almost paradoxical quality, in that risk has become both more consolidated and more atomized at the same time. On the one hand, large and complex financial institutions (LCFIs) which may be "too big to fail", increasingly dominate the banking landscape; on the other, these same institutions have shifted at least a portion of their risks onto other firms and households, whose absorptive capacity has yet to be severely tested. It is the effectiveness of the international supervisory architecture in the face of this risk environment that we consider, and we then provide some suggestions for future policy reforms.</p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>This paper reviews 80 years of cooperation among central banks. Diverse modes of collaboration are identified, ranging from simple exchange of relevant information to mutual financial support and coordination of monetary actions. Central bank cooperation got off to a rocky start in the 1930s, following the creation of the Bank for International Settlements in 1930, but it improved in the 1950s and especially in the 1960s. Most early cooperation was among European central banks, although need for a trans-Atlantic dimension was soon evident. By the end of the 20th century both the problems addressed and the participants were drawn from around the world. The alleged dangers of central bank cooperation are found to have been exaggerated.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>With the insight of 130 years of history, this paper tries to answer three questions: how did changing international monetary and financial conditions shape the targets and tools of central bank cooperation? What factors influenced its intensity? Did a structured organisation, such as the BIS, make a difference to its effectiveness? We show that while central bank cooperation through history was ultimately directed to ensuring monetary and financial stability, the conception of these objectives, the relationship between the two, the balance in their pursuit, and the strategies followed evolved over time reflecting changes in the monetary and financial environment as well as in the intellectual climate. In turn, the intensity of central bank cooperation was influenced by the state of international relations, the prestige and degree of autonomy of central banks and the technical nature of the issues requiring cooperation. We also argue that the BIS made a material difference, at least when conditions allowed.</p>

<p>This paper reviews analytical work carried out by central banks that participated in the Autumn Meeting of Central Bank Economists on "The evolving inflation process" which the BIS hosted on 28-29 October 2005. The paper first discusses efforts to document the univariate statistical properties of inflation and how they have changed over the last decades. It then reviews studies of disaggregated or micro inflation data and evidence from surveys of firms concerning their pricing behaviour. Using this micro evidence as background, the paper also attempts to understand the proximate causes for any changes in the inflation process, such as disparities in the price behaviour of tradables and non-tradables or movements in energy prices. The paper then summarises central bank research on changes in the ultimate determinants of factors impinging on the inflation process, for example a changing monetary policy regime, increased globalisation or a legislative reform of the labour market. </p>

<p>Several authors have recently interpreted the ECB's two-pillar framework as separate approaches to forecast and analyse inflation at different time horizons or frequency bands. The ECB has publicly supported this understanding of the framework. This paper presents further evidence on the behaviour of euro area inflation using band spectrum regressions, which allow for a natural definition of the short and long run in terms of specific frequency bands, and causality tests in the frequency domain. The main finding is that variations in inflation are well explained by low-frequency movements of money and real income growth and high-frequency fluctuations of the output gap. </p>

<p> We estimate output gaps using three methods for Mainland China on annual data spanning 1982 – 2003. The estimates are similar and appear to co-move with inflation. Standards Phillips curves, however, do not fit the data well. This may reflect the omission of some important variable(s) such as the effect of price deregulation, trade liberalisation and/or changes in the exchange rate regime. We reestimate the Phillips curves assuming that there is an unobserved variable that follows an AR(2) process. The modified model fits the data much better and accounts for some of the surprising features of the simple Phillips curve estimates.</p>

<p align="justify"> The successful pursuit of the objective of low inflation by central banks in recent decades has also delivered low variability of both inflation and output. At the same time, numerous financial and other "imbalances" (defined here as significant and sustained deviations from historical norms) have emerged. Should these imbalances revert to the mean, there could be significant effects on output growth. Although such an adverse outcome remains only a possibility, the question asked in this paper is whether we might still benefit from a new macrofinancial stabilisation framework in which monetary and regulatory policies gave more attention to avoiding the emergence of imbalances in the first place. </p>

<p align="justify">The relative importance of different mechanisms through which devaluations affect output are analyzed using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for a small open economy with imperfect competition and nominal rigidities. Devaluations are defined as an increase in the central bank's nominal exchange rate target, which induces a decrease in the nominal interest rate. Three main mechanisms through which devaluations affect output are considered: The traditional expansionary expenditure-switching effect, the balance sheet effect which allows the possibility of contractionary effects when firms' debt are dollar-denominated, and a monetary channel associated with an interest rule that targets the nominal exchange rate. The model is calibrated and simulated under alternative scenarios of exchange rate regimes and shocks. Devaluations are found to be expansionary despite the contractionary balance sheet effect. In response to adverse external shocks the economy's output response improves with a devaluation the less flexible the exchange rate regime is.</p>

<p> Prices of equity index put options contain information on the price of systematic downward jump risk. We use a structural jump-diffusion firm value model to assess the level of credit spreads that is generated by option-implied jump risk premia. In our compound option pricing model, an equity index option is an option on a portfolio of call options on the underlying firm values. We calibrate the model parameters to historical information on default risk, the equity premium and equity return distribution, and S&amp;P 500 index option prices. Our results show that a model without jumps fails to fit the equity return distribution and option prices, and generates a low out-of-sample prediction for credit spreads. Adding jumps and jump risk premia improves the fit of the model in terms of equity and option characteristics considerably and brings predicted credit spread levels much closer to observed levels. </p>

<p> <b>Abstract:</b> </p>
<p> Why are spreads on corporate bonds so wide relative to expected losses from default? The spread on Baa-rated bonds, for example, has been about four times the expected loss. We suggest that the most commonly cited explanations – taxes, liquidity and systematic diffusive risk – are inadequate. We argue instead that idiosyncratic default risk, or the risk of unexpected losses due to single- name defaults in necessarily "small" credit portfolios, accounts for the major part of spreads. Because return distributions are highly skewed, diversification would require very large portfolios. Evidence from arbitrage CDOs suggests that such diversification is not readily achievable in practice, and idiosyncratic risk is therefore unavoidable. Taking a cue from CDO subordination structures, we propose value-at-risk at the Aaa-rated confidence level as a summary measure of risk in feasible credit portfolios.

We provide stylized facts on the evolving shape dynamics of the US personal income distribution from 1962 to 2000. Based on adaptive kernel density estimation, we propose an adaptive bootstrap test for multimodality. Our results indicate that multimodality has been a predominant feature of the US income distribution. Both the number and location of modes change over time, revealing rich distributional dynamics and strong heterogeneity. Decomposing the sample by age, education, gender and race, all groups exhibit multiple modes and follow distinct distributional patterns. For all groups and for the population as a whole, income distribution improved over the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, but deteriorated dramatically in the 1990s.

We provide a robustness check of the US Phillips curve in the frequency domain. We design frequency-specific coeffcients of correlation (FSCC) and regression (FSCR), based on our frequency-specific data extraction procedure. Being real-valued, signed and normalised, the FSCC is superior to traditional indicators such as coherence and cospectrum. Our FSCC and FSCR estimates suggest that the Phillips tradeoffs vary greatly across frequencies, with frequent sign reversals. They seem to be stable in higher frequencies, but unstable in low and medium frequencies, and they are sensitive to the level and boundaries of frequency aggregation, to the way data are processed prior to analysis (eg detrending) and to the type of variables used. In this sense, the Phillips curves are fragile. The impact of potential cross-frequency model inconsistency on model estimation using conventional time domain methods needs careful scrutiny.

<p>This paper compares productivity developments across industrial countries based on official OECD data in the business sector. It discusses the uncertainties surrounding the measurement of both productivity levels and productivity growth, and then focuses on changes in productivity growth. The paper analyses labour productivity patterns and trends of total factor productivity (TFP) across countries. The recent performance of the United States clearly stands out. In particular, the level of US labour productivity appears to be the highest among the major industrial countries and has been rising the fastest in the recent past. Despite substantial uncertainties surrounding these international comparisons, there is little doubt that the US performance has improved sharply in relative terms. Productivity has accelerated in the United States but decelerated in most other industrial economies. Indeed, only a few countries have experienced a structural improvement in their productivity performance over recent years. Moreover, rather than just reflecting stronger capital accumulation, the US performance has been associated with a higher rate of technological progress that was maintained during the latest recession. In contrast, the accumulation of capital has been quite strong in most other major industrial economies. This might be a source of concern in some places, given the observed trend decline in the rate of technical progress.</p>

<p>A structural model with stochastic volatility and jumps implies particular relationships between observed equity returns and credit spreads. This paper explores such effects in the credit default swap (CDS) market. We use a novel approach to identify the realized jumps of individual equity from high frequency data. Our empirical results suggest that volatility risk alone predicts 50% of CDS spread variation, while jump risk alone forecasts 19%. After controlling for credit ratings, macroeconomic conditions, and firms' balance sheet information, we can explain 77% of the total variation. Moreover, the marginal impacts of volatility and jump measures increase dramatically from investment grade to high-yield entities. The estimated nonlinear effects of volatility and jumps are in line with the model implied relationships between equity returns and credit spreads.</p>

<p>What information about the financial condition of firms is conducive to efficient and stable operation of the financial system and of the economy more broadly? In this essay, we outline the contours of an ideal set of such information, identify existing gaps and propose a way forward to fill them. We argue that an ideal set should comprise two dimensions. As regards financial characteristics, it should cover three different types, viz: estimates of the current financial condition ("first-moment information"); estimates of risk profiles ("risk information"); and measures of the uncertainty surrounding both kinds of estimate ("measurement error information"). As regards the object of the analysis, it should cover information about both the individual firm ("micro information") and, suitably aggregated, the "system" as a whole ("macro information"). So far, efforts have mainly focused on micro information and, within it, on estimates of the current financial condition; by contrast, risk information has drawn attention only more recently and measurement error information has been largely neglected. We also note that, as regards micro information, significant differences in perspective between accounting standard setters and prudential supervisors have come to light. We examine the reasons for these differences and propose ways in which they could be reconciled. We propose a strategy based on two principles: first, in the long term, the "decoupling" of the objective of accurate financial reporting about the firm from that of instilling the desired degree of prudence in its behaviour; and second, a "parallel" process towards that objective so that at all points the prudential authorities can neutralise any undesirable implications for financial stability of changes in financial reporting standards. We stress that close cooperation between accounting standard setters and supervisory authorities is called for both in developing the final set of information and in implementing it.</p>

<p> This paper evaluates empirically the performance of six structural credit risk models by comparing the probabilities of default (PDs) they deliver to ex post default rates. In contrast to previous studies pursuing similar objectives, the paper employs firm-level data and finds that theory-based PDs tend to match closely the actual level of credit risk and to account for its time path. At the same time, nonmodelled macro variables from the financial and real sides of the economy help to substantially improve the forecasts of default rates. The finding suggests that theory-based PDs fail to fully reflect the dependence of credit risk on the business and credit cycles. Most of the upbeat conclusions regarding the performance of the PDs are due to models with endogenous default. For their part, frameworks that assume exogenous default tend to underpredict credit risk. Three borrower characteristics influence materially the predictions of the models: the leverage ratio; the default recovery rate; and the risk-free rate of return. </p>

The first part of the paper focuses on the approaches that central banks have found most useful in modelling exchange rate behaviour. We describe efforts to explain exchange rate behaviour ex post and to forecast its future evolution ex ante. We then summarise central banks' recent research on the linkage between exchange rates and inflation, output, profits and the current account. We highlight the main models and methodologies, the main empirical results and the key challenges ahead. The second part of the paper is devoted to research that examines the actual experience that countries have had in incorporating the exchange rate into their monetary policy decisions, and the main lessons learned. </p>

<p>This paper investigates whether a bank regulator should terminate problem banks promptly or exercise forbearance. We construct a dynamic model economy in which entrepreneurs pledge collateral, borrow from banks, and invest in long-term projects. We assume that collateral value has aggregate risk over time, that in any period entrepreneurs can abscond with the projects but losing the collateral, and that depositors can withdraw deposits. We show that optimal regulation exhibits forbearance if the ex-ante probability of collapse in collateral value is sufficiently low, but exhibits prompt termination of problem banks if this probability is sufficiently high.</p>

<p> This paper proposes a model of how agents adjust their asset holdings in response to losses in general equilibrium. By emphasising the relation between deflation and financial distress, we capture some original features of the early debt-deflation literature, such as distress selling, instability, and endogenous monetary contraction. </p>
<p> The agents affected by a shock sell off assets to prevent their debt from crowding out consumption. But their distress-selling causes a decline in equilibrium prices, and the resulting losses elicit reactions by all agents. This activates several channels of debt-deflation. Yet we show that this process remains stable, even in the presence of large shocks, high indebtedness, and wide-spread default. What keeps the asset market stable is the presence of agents without prior debt or losses, who borrow to exploit the expected asset price recovery. By contrast, debt-deflation becomes unstable when agents try to contain their indebtedness, or when a credit crunch interferes with the accommodation necessary for stability. </p>

<p>We seek to assess the effect of commercial property price movements on the behaviour and performance of individual banks in a range of industrialised economies, extending the existing micro literature on bank performance. Our results suggest that commercial property prices tend to be positively associated with bank lending and profitability, and negatively associated with banks' net interest margin and bad loan ratios. Such an impact exists even when conventional independent variables determining bank performance are included as controls. Further extensions show that the magnitude of this impact is related to the size of the bank, the strength of bank capitalisation, the direction of commercial property price movements, and regional factors. The results have implications for risk managers, regulators and monetary policy makers. Notably, they underline the crucial relevance of commercial property prices as a macroprudential variable that warrants close scrutiny by the authorities.</p>

<p>This paper analyses how fiscal policy affects monetary policy in emerging economies. First, it conducts a test for fiscal dominance, and finds that the evidence points clearly to a regime of fiscal dominance in the case of Argentina and Brazil during the 1990s and early 2000s, while for the other countries in the sample the results are mixed. Next, the paper evaluates whether monetary policy accommodates fiscal policy, by assessing whether fiscal variables enter significantly in the central bank's reaction function. The findings indicate that in the emerging markets under consideration the conduct of monetary policy is not directly affected by changes in real primary balances. Then, the paper explores another mechanism through which fiscal policy could affect monetary policy in an emerging economy, by looking at the impact of fiscal policy on country premium and exchange rates. The empirical analysis is conducted through an event study, assessing the impact of news concerning fiscal variables and fiscal policy, on sovereign spread and exchange rate daily movements in Brazil, during the period surrounding the 2002 macroeconomic crisis. The results show that fiscal events have significantly influenced sovereign spreads and exchange rates in that period. Furthermore, fiscal policy actions appear to have contributed to movements in the exchange rates more than unanticipated monetary policy manoeuvres. The findings also suggest that, at that time, fiscal policy might have pushed the economy into an equilibrium in which increases in the policy intervention rate were likely to be associated with a depreciation, rather than an appreciation of the exchange rate.</p>

We survey the literature on the efficacy of foreign exchange market intervention in emerging market countries, emphasising the differences with the literature on industrial countries. We then use official statistics on central bank intervention by the Czech National Bank in conjunction with options market data, to study the impact of intervention during 2001-02. We find that central bank intervention had some (weakly) statistically significant impact on the spot rate and the risk reversal but that this impact was small. We do not find evidence that intervention had an influence on short-term exchange rate volatility. We also find that, in our sample period, Czech authorities appeared to intervene mainly in response to an acceleration of the speed of koruna appreciation.

This paper examines the role of the natural rate of interest in the conduct of monetary policy. The natural rate figures prominently in many theories of the business cycle and of inflation fluctuations, and therefore has the potential to play a key role in monetary policy given the current mandates of many central banks. However, the presence of financial imperfections and measurement uncertainty draw into question whether estimates of the natural rate can be reliable indicators of excess demand pressures. Natural rate-based theories may, nonetheless, provide useful guidance in the formulation of desirable monetary policies.

<p>The paper develops a model of an IMF-like coinsurance arrangement among member countries. First, it shows that a coinsurance arrangement among countries can, in principle, play a useful role in helping countries bear the risks involved in developing their economies and becoming part of the global financial system. Second, the operation of the coinsurance arrangement is examined under different loan contracts offered by the IMF. The analysis suggests that, if the IMF's objective is to safeguard its resources and be concerned about the welfare of the borrower, an ex ante loan contract (that is a contract agreed to before problems arise) is more likely to create the right incentives - induce higher effort by member countries to avoid and overcome crises - than an ex-post loan contract (that is a contract made after problems arise). Such ex ante contracts highlight the need for precommitment to contend with the Samaritan's dilemma and time inconsistency. It also shows that state-contingent repayment schemes are needed to deal with King Lear's dilemma.</p>

This paper examines episodes of current account adjustment in industrial countries over the past 30 years. We find that they were typically associated with a sizeable slowdown in domestic growth and a large exchange rate depreciation. There was no discernable change in the nature of capital flows in the period just prior to an adjustment, with the possible exception of non-residents' holdings of currency and deposits. This suggests that a current account adjustment may be an endogenous event - responding to the resolution of domestic imbalances - rather than an exogenous event where the size of the current account deficit itself precipitates the adjustment in the domestic economy and the exchange rate. Econometric evidence suggests that global developments trigger the adjustment, possibly because they trigger the unwinding of the domestic imbalances. We find that the bulk of the ex post adjustment of the financial account was in private sector flows, primarily on the part of foreign investors. Finally, we document some notable differences in the adjustment of the current account in the United States in 1987 compared with that observed in the other episodes.

This paper attempts to conceptualize the debate regarding the role of asset prices and perceived financial imbalances in the formation of monetary policy from the perspective of theoretically optimal policy responses. While much of the disagreement can be reconciled within the framework of flexible inflation targeting, defined as a commitment to a targeting rule, preemptive policy actions against the build-up of financial imbalances cannot be motivated within such a framework without modification either to the targeting rule or the underlying model. Given standard forecasting models, such actions are shown to be operationally equivalent to targeting financial imbalances explicitly in the central bank loss function.

This paper links banking with asset prices in a monetary macroeconomic model. The main innovation is to consider how falling asset prices affect the banking system through wide-spread borrower default, while deriving explicit solutions and balance sheet effects even far from the steady state. We find that the effect of falling asset prices is indirect, non-linear, and involves feedback from the banking system in the form of a credit contraction. When borrowers repay, the effect 'passes through' the bank balance sheet; once borrowers default, asset prices drive bank capital, and constrained credit in turn drives asset prices. This interaction can explain capital crunches, financial instability, and banking crises, either as fundamental or as self-fulfilling outcomes. This model, unlike others, distinguishes between financial and macroeconomic stability, and makes precise the notion of balance sheet vulnerability. It also carries regulatory implications and adds to the debate on asset prices and monetary policy. The case studies apply the model to Japan's Lost Decade, the Nordic Banking Crises, and the US Great Depression.

The empirical methodology of the paper establishes if a speculative attack, which is accounted for via sunspots in the presence of multiple equilibria, could have been in fact driven uniquely by economic fundamentals. The methodology is based on the theoretical models of Bertola and Svensson (1993) and Tarashev (2003). The first model captures robust stylised facts from target zone regimes, whereas the second one implies that both unique and multiple equilibria can account for violent speculative attacks. The characteristics of the theoretical foundations and their implications for the employed statistical test distinguish the paper from previous structural empirical analyses of market bets against pegged currencies. The methodology is applied to the experience of two ERM countries in the fall of 1992. The attack on the French Franc is found to be triggered by sunspots, whereas it is impossible to determine whether a similar scenario or the state of the economy alone underpins the currency crisis in Italy.

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of macro stress-testing methodologies. Substantial progress has been made both in the econometric analysis of financial soundness indicators and in the simulation of value-at-risk measures to assess system-wide vulnerabilities. However, a number of methodological challenges still remain concerning the correlation of market and credit risks over time and across institutions, the limited time horizon generally used for the analysis and the potential instability of reduced-form parameter estimates because of feedback effects. Further research in this area might also focus on how to use macro stress-testing techniques as an operational tool to incorporate financial stability considerations into monetary policy decision-making.

It is well known that Japanese banks increased their exposure to land assets and the real estate sector in the latter half of the 1980s, and that this became a primary factor in the non-performing loan problem that emerged in the 1990s. What is less clear is whether this increased exposure was the result of active risk taking, and whether banks and other market participants regarded land and real estate assets as "risky" during the period of land price appreciation. To address this issue, we rely on the real estate data contained in corporate balance sheets to extract an estimate of the market sentiment toward land assets during the 1985-89 period. We find that the systematic risk of manufacturing companies increased with their real estate holdings but not with holdings of other balance sheet assets. This result indicates that market participants regarded real estate assets as riskier than the main operations of manufacturing companies during the "bubble period", even if they may not have foreseen the subsequent crash in real estate prices.

Rating collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), which are based on tranched pools of credit risk exposures, does not only require attributing a probability of default to each obligor within the portfolio. It also involves assumptions concerning recovery rates and correlated defaults of pool assets, thus combining credit risk assessments of individual collateral assets with estimates about default correlations and other modelling assumptions. In this paper, we explain one of the most well-known models for rating CDOs, the so-called binomial expansion technique (BET). Comparing this approach with an alternative methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation, we then highlight the potential importance of correlation assumptions for the ratings of senior CDO tranches and explore what differences in methodologies across rating agencies may mean for senior tranche rating outcomes. The remainder of the paper talks about potential implications of certain model assumptions for ratings accuracy, that is the "model risk" taken by investors when acquiring CDO tranches, and whether and under what conditions methodological differences may generate incentives for issuers to strategically select rating agencies to get particular CDO structures rated.

This paper summarises fiscal developments over the past 10 years in 16 industrial countries, based on OECD data and projections. Several countries that had substantial fiscal deficits early in the 1990s turned to surpluses by the year 2000, with some countries improving their fiscal balances by 5% of GDP or more, even abstracting from the effects of strong economic growth. But in many countries - especially the largest economies - this strong performance had given way to the reappearance of large fiscal deficits by 2003. Based on current fiscal legislation, the OECD expects to see no clear improvement in cyclically adjusted balances by 2005. All countries' fiscal positions in 2003 were worse than had been expected in late 2000, but after abstracting from the effects of a surprisingly weak economy, the negative surprise was largest for the United States, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland. Sustainability calculations suggest that preventing rising net debt ratios requires a fiscal adjustment of some 7% of GDP in Japan, 2½ to 3% of GDP in the United States, 1½% of GDP in the United Kingdom, and about 1% of GDP in France and Germany. Italy's fiscal position is strong enough to stabilise the debt ratio at its current high level, but not strong enough to bring the debt ratio down appreciably.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 September 2004', 'title': 'Recent fiscal policy in selected industrial countries ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work162.htm', 'author': 'David Lebow', 'keyword': 'fiscal policy', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work162.pdf'}

Japan's government debt is extremely high, especially considering the fact that the data exclude likely future liabilities stemming from an ageing population and possible requirements of the financial system. Nevertheless, an offsetting factor is the degree to which the Bank of Japan has already monetised the debt. The monetary expansion up to the end of 2003 has increased the net worth of the Bank of Japan, properly measured, to more than 17% of GDP, directly reducing the debt position of the consolidated government and central bank - the most relevant measure of the government's fiscal position. Furthermore, the consolidated debt ratio could fall further depending both on the degree to which the monetary expansion is reversed to prevent inflation from rising too much and on the response of nominal interest rates to any temporary inflation that does occur. Under reasonable scenarios, the consolidated government/central bank debt position could be noticeably lower than indicated by commonly cited debt statistics.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 September 2004', 'title': "The monetisation of Japan's government debt ", 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work161.htm', 'author': 'David Lebow', 'keyword': 'monetisation, Japan, government debt', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work161.pdf'}

This paper compares the pricing of credit risk in the bond market and the fast-growing credit default swap (CDS) market. The empirical findings confirm the theoretical prediction that bond spreads and CDS spreads move together in the long run. Nevertheless, in the short run this relationship does not always hold. The deviation is largely due to different responses of the two markets to changes in credit conditions. By looking into the dynamic linkages between the two spreads, I find that the CDS market often moves ahead of the bond market in price adjustment, particularly for US entities. Liquidity also matters for their role in price discovery. Surprisingly, the terms of CDS contracts and the short-sale restriction in the cash market only have a very small impact.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 August 2004', 'title': 'An empirical comparison of credit spreads between the bond market and the credit default swap market ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work160.htm', 'author': 'Haibin Zhu', 'keyword': 'credit spreads comparison, bond market, credit default swap market', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work160.pdf'}

This paper analyses the peculiar nature of credit risk in project finance by means of a comparative econometric analysis of ex ante credit spreads for a large cross section of international loans and bonds between 1993 and 2001 in both industrialised and emerging countries. 
<p align="justify"> Our main contribution relates to the analysis of the term structure of credit spreads for project finance loans compared to other loans and bonds. For both investment-grade and speculative-grade bonds used for purposes other than project financing, we find that the term structure of credit spreads can reasonably be approximated by a linear positive function of maturity, once other relevant micro and macro risk factors have been controlled for. For project finance loans, instead, we show that the term structure of credit spreads is hump-shaped. This result applies to both industrialised as well as emerging countries and appears robust to a large number of sensitivity tests, controlling also for possible sample selection bias or endogeneity of maturity choice. We emphasise a number of key features of project finance structures that might underlie this finding. In particular, we illustrate the mechanisms by which higher leverage, short-term liquidity concerns due to the exclusive reliance on project cash flows as well as the sequential resolution of risks along various project advancement stages might all alleviate the perceived risk of longer-maturity project finance loans. </p>
<p align="justify"> This paper offers a number of policy implications. It provides a cross-country assessment of the riskmitigating role of explicit or implicit guarantees from multilateral development banks and export credit agencies in project finance. It also makes a number of suggestions for bank regulators on how to effectively align capital requirements with the actual term structure of credit risk in project finance. In particular, our results indicate that a linear maturity adjustment to regulatory capital with slope inversely related to the probability of default might not be applicable to project finance exposures. We acknowledge, however, that introducing different maturity adjustments for different asset classes, while improving the risk sensitivity of capital requirements, would also add to the complexity of their implementation. </p>

<p>Since the 1980s, a number of episodes of financial market distress have underscored the importance of the smooth functioning of markets for the stability of the financial system. At the heart of these episodes was a sudden and drastic reduction in market liquidity, characterised by disorderly adjustments in asset prices, a sharp increase in the costs of executing transactions and, in the most acute cases, a "seizing up" of markets. This essay explores the anatomy of market distress as well as the policy options to address it. It argues that, despite appearances, the genesis and dynamics of market distress resemble quite closely those of banking distress and that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the growth of markets for tradable instruments, and hence the greater scope to sell assets and raise cash, need not have reduced the likelihood of funding (liquidity) crises. At times of distress, in contrast to more normal times, risk management practices, funding constraints and counterparty risk become critical determinants of market liquidity. Articulating an appropriate policy response calls for an approach that takes full account of the interdependencies between the behaviour of market participants and market dynamics. To date, much useful work has been done to address market distress by improving the market infrastructure and the risk management at individual financial institutions. The territory that remains largely unexplored is precisely the link between the collective actions of individual market participants and market dynamics.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '04 July 2004', 'title': 'Market distress and vanishing liquidity: anatomy and policy options ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work158.htm', 'author': 'Claudio Borio', 'keyword': 'Market distress and vanishing liquidity: anatomy and policy options', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work158.pdf'}

<p>We argue that in order to achieve price stability in a sustainable way, central banks should consider paying greater attention to credit in their monetary policy strategies than is generally the case at present. Specifically, simply setting monetary policy so that a two-year inflation forecast is at the central bank's target may, on occasions, be less than optimal. In particular, the central bank may wish to deviate from such a strategy when developments in the financial system are exposing the macroeconomy to materially increased risk. Doing so calls for longer policy horizons together with an explicit incorporation into policy decisions of the balance of risks in the outlook. One important indicator that risk is building up is unusually sustained and rapid credit growth occurring alongside unusually sustained and large increases in asset prices ("financial imbalances"). Building on previous work, we show that empirical proxies for financial imbalances contain useful information about subsequent banking crises, output and inflation beyond traditional two-year policy horizons. On the basis of Taylor rule-type descriptions of policy, we also investigate the response of central banks to financial imbalances. We find evidence that, at least until recently, central banks generally either have not responded to imbalances systematically or, to the extent that they have, have done so asymmetrically, loosening policy further than normal in the face of their unwinding but not tightening it beyond normal as they build up.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '02 July 2004', 'title': 'Securing sustainable price stability: should credit come back from the wilderness?

This paper provides empirical evidence on the impact of deposit insurance on the growth of bank intermediation in the long run. We use a unique dataset capturing a variety of deposit insurance features across countries, such as coverage, premium structure, etc. and synthesize available information by means of principal component indices. This paper specifically addresses sample selection and endogeneity concerns by estimating a generalized Tobit model both via maximum likelihood and the Heckman 2-step method. The empirical construct is guided by recent theories of banking regulation that employ an agency framework. The basic moral hazard problem is the incentive for depository institutions to engage in excessively high-risk activities, relative to socially optimal outcomes, in order to increase the option value of their deposit insurance guarantee. The overall empirical evidence is consistent with the likelihood that generous government-funded deposit insurance might have a negative impact on the long-run growth and stability of bank intermediation, except in countries where the rule of law is well established and bank supervisors are granted sufficient discretion and independence from legal reprisals. Insurance premium requirements on member banks, even when risk-adjusted, are instead found to have little effect in restraining banks' risk-taking behavior.

The issue of monetary policy and asset prices has been receiving much attention not only because it is an interesting topic for macroeconomists but also because central banks have faced daunting challenges from large swings in various types of asset prices. To some extent, the achievement of a low, stable inflation environment has not simultaneously brought about a more stable asset price environment. The record over the past decade, in fact, has raised the prospect of asset price booms and busts as a permanent feature of the monetary policy landscape. This paper lays out a general framework to explore some of the key monetary policy trade-offs presented by asset prices, with particular emphasis on the role of asset price bubbles. 
<p align="justify"> The paper first discusses what economists mean by asset price bubbles before putting forward a stylised macroeconomic model in which a monetary authority can influence the behaviour, in only an indirect way, of the path of asset prices. The baseline model suggests that central banks should systematically respond to asset price developments generally and asset price bubbles specifically. Indeed, there are good reasons for the central bank to focus only on asset price bubbles, rather than the fundamental component of asset prices, when calibrating its monetary policy response. This general result does not depend on the volatility of asset prices per se or necessarily on the ability to distinguish fundamental movements in asset prices from asset price bubbles. The paper then introduces a form of uncertainty - intrinsic paradigm uncertainty about the existence of bubbles - to show how policymakers might want to weigh the options of responding or not responding in such an environment. The paper then goes beyond the confines of the model to offer insights about issues such as moral hazard, non-linearities, multivariate bubbles and communication strategies. </p>

The appreciation of the dollar in the aftermath of the launch of the euro came as a surprise to most observers; furthermore, traditional models do not seem to be able to capture the fluctuations of the dollar/euro exchange rate. Is this a confirmation of earlier research according to which no structural model can explain exchange rate dynamics? More optimistically, this study shows that a structural VAR model of the Mundell-Fleming type well explains the behaviour of the euro and its relationships with the fundamentals. Our estimates indicate that the dollar appreciation is primarily due to the cyclical strength of US demand. By contrast, they do not support the often-voiced theory that the appreciation of the dollar is explained by the "new economy". Finally, the model shows that monetary shocks have limited effects on the exchange rate and very strong ones on inflation.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 June 2004', 'title': 'Monetary and real shocks, the business cycle and the value of the euro ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work154.htm', 'author': 'Renato Filosa', 'keyword': 'Monetary and real shocks, value of the euro', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work154.pdf'}

Household borrowing has grown considerably in many countries over the past two decades, both in absolute terms and relative to household incomes. Much of the increase can be viewed as a rational response by households to the effects of easing liquidity constraints on households, and lower inflation and borrowing rates. Regardless of whether the increase in debt is sustainable, it has important macroeconomic implications. The household sector will be more sensitive to shocks to interest rates and household incomes, and consumption spending will be more sensitive to changes in expectations of future income. The increased sensitivity will depend crucially on the distribution of debt across the household sector.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 June 2004', 'title': 'Macroeconomic implications of rising household debt ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work153.htm', 'author': 'Guy Debelle', 'keyword': 'Macroeconomic implications of rising household debt', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work153.pdf'}

<p>The rhetoric of deflation has become more prevalent in policy circles and in the press despite the fact that deflation has been a rare phenomenon in modern fiat currency economies. To better understand the nature of deflation, this paper looks back to a period when deflation was a regular feature of the economic environment, across both time and a wide set of countries. One feature of the deflation record stands clear. During the 19th century and early 20th century, deflation was not generally associated with persistent and deep economic malaise. Most periods of deflation also appear to have been largely unanticipated, with interest rates rarely approaching their zero lower bound. One notable exception to this typical pattern was the Great Depression of the early 1930s, the event that nowadays colours current general perceptions of what deflationary episodes might look like. At the risk of oversimplification, one way to think about this broad sweep of history is that deflations come in three basic types: the good, the bad and the ugly. The paper then jumps forward in time, seeking to draw lessons from the past about the possibility of future episodes of deflation and their characteristics. In doing so, it pays particular attention to the similarities and differences in the monetary and financial regimes prevailing now and in the past. While great care should be taken in any such exercise, the paper concludes that certain features of the past can help to shed some light on the policy challenges that policymakers might face in the future.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '05 March 2004', 'title': 'Back to the future?

The banking literature has established that banks can alleviate information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers, while the Q literature has used cash flow sensitivity analysis to test whether financing constraints hinder investment. Building on the results in Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein (1991) and Hayashi (2000), this paper investigates whether bank ties in Japan were costly for mature and healthy firms in the 1980s and 1990s and whether banks continued to facilitate investment once non-bank financing options became available. Using the explicit bond issuing criteria to solve the endogenous firm sorting problem, I measure the investment-cash flow sensitivity of Japanese firms, and find it lowest for those firms known to have faced bond market constraints. I then find that the spread in sensitivity was much larger for main bank client firms, once bond market access is controlled for. This result, coupled with results on the relative profitability and bond activity of bank-affiliated firms, is consistent with banks capturing the net benefits of relationship lending during the period of bond market deregulation.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 March 2004', 'title': 'Bank ties and bond market access: evidence on investment-cash flow sensitivity in Japan ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work151.htm', 'author': 'Patrick McGuire', 'keyword': 'Japan, Bank ties and bond market access, investment-cash flow sensitivity', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work151.pdf'}

<p>Motivated by the frequently observed link between commercial property price volatility and banking crises, this paper investigates at a macroeconomic level the determination of commercial property prices and the interaction between commercial property prices and bank lending. We develop a reduced-form theoretical model which suggests bank lending is closely related to commercial property prices and that commercial property can develop cycles given plausible assumptions, where the cycles are largely driven by the dynamic linkage between the commercial property sector, bank credit and the macroeconomy. Cross-country empirical analysis based on a sample of 17 developed economies, using a unique dataset collected by the BIS, confirms the model's predictions. An investigation of determinants of commercial property prices shows particularly strong links of credit to commercial property in the countries that experienced banking crises linked to property losses in 1985-95. Further studies of dynamic interaction suggest that commercial property prices are rather "autonomous", in that they tend to cause credit expansion, rather than excessive bank lending boosting property prices. In addition, GDP has an important influence on both commercial property prices and bank credit. The work has implications for risk management and prudential supervision.</p>

<p>The paper reviews the recent conduct of monetary policy and central banks' interest rate setting behaviour in emerging market economies. Using a standard open economy reaction function, we test whether central banks in emerging economies react to changes in inflation, output gaps and the exchange rate in a consistent and predictable manner. In most emerging economies the interest rate responds strongly to the exchange rate; in some, the response is higher than that to changes in the inflation rate or the output gap. The result is robust to alternative specification and estimation methods. This highlights the importance of the exchange rate as a source of shock and supports the "fear of floating" hypothesis. Evidence also suggests that in some countries the central bank's response to a negative inflation shock might be weaker than to a positive shock.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '02 March 2004', 'title': 'Monetary policy rules in emerging market economies: issues and evidence ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work149.htm', 'author': 'Madhusudan Mohanty, Marc Klau', 'keyword': 'monetary policy rules, emerging market economies', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work149.pdf'}

How predictable was the recent US recession? This paper evaluates the accuracy of several recession prediction models. In particular, traditional rule-of-thumb models using the composite index of leading indicators (CLI), Neftçi's sequential probability model, a probit model, and Stock and Watson's experimental recession indexes are compared. Despite the relatively mild depth of the recession, the models using the CLI performed particularly well. The results are robust across different types of models and with respect to the use of real-time data. The strong real-time performance stands at odds with earlier sceptical claims about the marginal usefulness of the CLI in predicting cyclical turning points, and complements the results in the earlier research of Filardo (1999). At a more conceptual level, the paper provides general support to the classical business cycle view that turning points of business cycles from expansion to recession are complex, possibly endogenous and nonlinear, phenomena. The results also suggest that the impressive insights of Geoffrey Moore into the theory and construction of the CLI will continue to shape our understanding of business cycles well into the future.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 March 2004', 'title': 'The 2001 US recession: what did recession prediction models tell us?

Although credit history scoring offers benefits to lenders and borrowers, failure to consider situational circumstances raises important statistical issues that may affect the ability of scoring systems to accurately quantify an individual's credit risk. Evidence from a national sample of credit reporting agency records suggests that failure to consider measures of local economic circumstances and individual trigger events when developing credit history scores can diminish the potential effectiveness of such models. There are practical difficulties, however, associated with developing scoring models that incorporate situational data, arising largely because of inherent limitations of the credit reporting agency databases used to build scoring models.

Significant attention has recently been directed to the optimal policy response when financial excesses threaten. This paper rather addresses issues pertinent to the appropriate policy response once financial difficulties have actually materialised. It begins with some empirical evidence concerning recent changes in financial structure (marketisation, globalisation and consolidation) and documents the rise in the number and variety of episodes of financial instability. The paper then goes on to examine the rationale for government intervention (use of safety net instruments) to reduce the costs of such financial instability, and cautiously concludes that the use of a number of such instruments has been on the rise. Moreover, the balance among them has also been changing. An attempt is then made to link these evolving policy responses back to the underlying changes in financial structure identified earlier. 
<p align="justify"> Since the use of safety net instruments always implies in principle some element of moral hazard, the paper concludes with an empirical evaluation of whether this seems to be a matter of practical importance, and whether "good design" might not have the potential to materially reduce such concerns. The conclusion reached is that sensible policies designed to contain the damage arising from financial instability can have less desirable longer-term consequences. Policymakers thus continue to face an inter-temporal optimisation problem.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '04 January 2004', 'title': 'Are changes in financial structure extending safety nets?

This paper aims to explain differences in inflation between six central European economies - Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - and the euro area in terms of differences in productivity growth between tradable and non-tradable sectors. The coverage of tradable and non-tradable sectors is broader and more detailed than in previous studies and the data samples are larger, as quarterly data for up to 10 years are used. The main conclusion is that productivity differentials explain on average only between 0.2 and 2.0 percentage points of annual inflation differentials vis-à-vis the euro area. Productivity differentials also explain only a small proportion of domestic inflation in central European economies. Earlier studies that estimated the Balassa-Samuelson effect to be larger have often neglected to consider the impact of productivity differentials on inflation relative to the euro area, focusing instead only on their impact on domestic inflation. Many studies have also neglected the relatively high productivity growth in non-tradable industries. The estimates in this paper suggest that differences in productivity growth between EU accession countries and the euro area are unlikely to widen sufficiently to become a determining factor in the ability of these countries to satisfy the Maastricht inflation criterion.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 October 2003', 'title': 'The Balassa-Samuelson effect in central Europe: a disaggregated analysis ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work143.htm', 'author': 'Marc Klau, Dubravko Mihaljek', 'keyword': 'Balassa-Samuelson effect, central Europe, productivity, inflation, EMU, transition', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work143.pdf'}

This paper provides for the first time a comparative study of three major banking crises in Norway (1899-1905, 1920-28 and 1988-92), and presents financial and macroeconomic data spanning more than 130 years. Financial sector development appears to be closely linked to booms and busts in economic activity during these years. The boom periods that preceded each of the three crises all have some common features: they were characterised by significant bank expansion, considerable asset price inflation and increased indebtedness. The non-financial sector increased its debt only slightly more than its income during the first two boom periods, but subsequent deflation increased its debt burden. A puzzle in the two first boom periods was that the commercial bank equity-to-total assets ratio increased markedly. Nonetheless, the commercial banks were severely affected in the each subsequent bust. Possible explanations are provided, but this puzzle calls for more research. Altogether, a strong causal link between financial fragility and banking crises is suggested. The crises occurred in different institutional environments and monetary policy regimes, and the role of these is explored and policy lessons are drawn. In particular, the close link between monetary and financial stability is highlighted.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 October 2003', 'title': 'Three episodes of financial fragility in Norway since the 1890s ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work142.htm', 'author': 'Karsten Gerdrup', 'keyword': 'financial fragility in Norway, banking crises in Norway', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work142.pdf'}

We analyse the case of persistent deflation in Japan by estimating the long-run Phillips curve equation using the GDP deflator and the estimated GDP gap. Then we show that the Japanese banking sector has been losing money since the early 1990s due to the heavy credit cost and that it is quickly running out of capital. The Japanese government has been preventing a banking crisis by providing a blanket guarantee on most banking sector liabilities. However, the government is facing a rapid deterioration of financial conditions due to massive budget deficits and the negative nominal GDP growth in recent years. In spite of the quantitative easing of monetary policy, the traditional interest rate policy has lost its potency due to the zero lower bound of nominal interest rates and accelerating deflation. Without stopping deflation quickly, the Japanese government may face capital flight due to the uncontrolled budget deficit. In order to cope with this unusual situation, two nontraditional policy measures are proposed: massive open market purchases of high-quality real assets and a negative nominal interest policy by levying tax on all government-guaranteed yen financial assets.

We develop a small open economy macroeconomic model where financial conditions influence aggregate behavior. We use this model to explore the connection between the exchange rate regime and financial distress. Fixed exchange rates are shown to exacerbate financial crises. Quantitative exercises calibrated to match the Korean experience during the recent Asian crisis are able to replicate key macroeconomic outcomes including the sharp increase in lending rates and the observed drop in output, investment and productivity during the 1997-1998 episode. These exercises imply that welfare losses following a financial crisis are significantly larger under fixed exchange rates relative to flexible exchange rates.

This paper examines the impact of public information in an economy where agents also have diverse private information. Since disclosures by central banks are an important source of public information, we are able to assess how the words of central bankers shape expectations, in addition to their actions. In an otherwise standard macro model, the disproportionate role of public information degrades the information value of economic outcomes, alters the welfare consequences of increased precision of public information and generates distinctive time series characteristics of some macro variables.

The experience of the 1990s renewed economists' interest in the role of credit in macroeconomic fluctuations. The locus classicus of the credit-boom view of economic cycles is the expansion of the 1920s and the Great Depression. In this paper we ask how well quantitative measures of the credit boom phenomenon can explain the uneven expansion of the 1920s and the slump of the 1930s. We complement this macroeconomic analysis with three sectoral studies that shed further light on the explanatory power of the credit boom interpretation: the property market, consumer durables industries, and high-tech sectors. We conclude that the credit boom view provides a useful perspective on both the boom of the 1920s and the subsequent slump. In particular, it directs attention to the role played by the structure of the financial sector and the interaction of finance and innovation. The credit boom and its ultimate impact were especially pronounced where the organisation and history of the financial sector led intermediaries to compete aggressively in providing credit. And the impact on financial markets and the economy was particularly evident in countries that saw the development of new network technologies with commercial potential that in practice took considerable time to be realised. In addition, the structure of management of the monetary regime mattered importantly. The procyclical character of the foreign exchange component of global international reserves and the failure of domestic monetary authorities to use stable policy rules to guide the more discretionary approach to monetary management that replaced the more rigid rules-based gold standard of the earlier era are key for explaining the developments in credit markets that helped to set the stage for the Great Depression.

Recent financial instability has called into question the sufficiency of low inflation as a goal for monetary policy. This paper discusses interwar literature bearing on this question. It begins with theories of the cycle based on the quantity theory, and their policy prescription of price stability supported by lender of last resort activities in the event of crises, arguing that their neglect of fluctuations in investment was a weakness. Other approaches are then taken up, particularly Austrian theory, which stressed the banking system's capacity to generate relative price distortions and forced saving. This theory was discredited by its association with nihilistic policy prescriptions during the Great Depression. Nevertheless, its core insights were worthwhile, and also played an important part in Robertson's more eclectic account of the cycle. The latter, however, yielded activist policy prescriptions of a sort that were discredited in the postwar period. Whether these now need re-examination, or whether a low-inflation regime, in which the authorities stand ready to resort to vigorous monetary expansion in the aftermath of asset market problems, is adequate to maintain economic stability is still an open question.

In the late 1990s, Morris and Shin proposed a new theoretical framework of financial crises, which generalised traditional models of strategic complementarity and self-fulfilling beliefs by incorporating idiosyncratic uncertainty about the state. The innovative feature of their framework is expressed by its capacity to account for seemingly unwarranted speculative attacks under equilibrium uniqueness and to thus place policy analysis on a firm footing. The macroeconomic implications of the framework have been questioned, however, because it ignores the issue of information aggregation via market prices. Motivated by such criticism, this paper modifies the Morris-Shin setup by allowing prices to adjust freely to market conditions. It is then shown that all of the appealing characteristics of that setup are preserved even when public information has an endogenously disseminated component. Moreover, the prevailing weak form of strategic complementarity, in conjunction with heterogeneity of private agents' information sets, leads to a less restrictive prerequisite for equilibrium uniqueness. Further, the paper's model delivers new policy implications and suggests a change in the approach of structural currency crisis empirical analysis.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 September 2003', 'title': 'Currency Crises and the Informational Role of Interest Rates ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work135.htm', 'author': 'Nikola Tarashev', 'keyword': 'financial crises, currency crises', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work135.pdf'}

The advent of the euro has eroded many of the barriers that segmented the European corporate bond market along currency lines and given rise to a unified market comparable in size to the one denominated in US dollars. In doing so, the new currency has made it easier for investment banks to explore scale economies in the provision of underwriting services, lowered the entry barriers to this industry, and made it easier for European borrowers to benefit from scope economies by combining their purchasing of commercial and investment banking services. This paper shows that the arrival of the euro led to a reduction in the underwriting fees of corporate bonds issued in the new currency and that this reduction was largely due to greater contestability of the investment banking business in the post-EMU European market. Our paper also shows that the elimination of market segmentation led to a migration of underwriting business towards the larger international investment banking houses, particularly those from the United States, rather than an intensification of the business links between euro area borrowers and bankers from the same country. Moreover, borrowers that chose American investment banks appear to have made extra savings in the underwriting fees. Finally, our analysis shows that these fee savings were not overcome by an increase in the credit spreads of these borrowers' bonds at issue date. Altogether, these results suggest that borrowers attach more weight to placing capacity than to business relationships in the choice of an underwriter.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 September 2003', 'title': 'The cost of barriers to entry: evidence from the market for corporate euro bond underwriting ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work134.htm', 'author': 'João Santos, Kostas Tsatsaronis', 'keyword': 'market segmentation, corporate bond underwriting, euro', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work134.pdf'}

The paper examines the quality of the BankScope database, by comparing results based on it to those obtained from the population-level data for India disseminated by the Reserve Bank of India. Despite good coverage and minor reporting errors in the individual reported units, strong evidence of selectivity bias in BankScope data for India is found. A major source of the selectivity bias for India is the almost total omission of Regional Rural Banks and Foreign Banks. It is shown that this selectivity bias affects estimates of all summary statistical measures and could lead users of the data to conclude that the Indian banking market is unimodal when, in reality, it is segmented and has a bimodal pattern. Kolmogorov-Smironov tests reveal that neither the distribution of the log of total assets nor that of market shares based on the BankScope data could be treated same as the corresponding population distributions for India. Despite these limitations, the paper shows that a few popularly used market concentration measures could be estimated from BankScope data accurately, provided the coverage ratio with respect to the size variable is known from alternative sources and is adequate. Coverage of about 90% with respect to the size variable is found to be sufficient for approximating population HHI. For k-bank concentration measures, accurate estimates could be obtained if, in addition, the top k banks in the population are also available in the sample. In contrast, for entropy measures, results indicate that adequate coverage with respect to both the size variable and the number of financial entities would be required.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 September 2003', 'title': 'How good is the BankScope database?

We analyse in an extensive risk return framework the determinants of the pricing of 5,000-plus syndicated credits granted to developing country borrowers between 1993 and 2001. Syndicated loans with riskier characteristics or granted to riskier borrowers are found to be more expensive than others, although the effect of purely microeconomic price determinants is in several instances weaker when macroeconomic conditions in borrowers' countries are also controlled for. In addition to individual loan or borrower considerations, lenders seem to focus more on macroeconomic factors to determine the pricing of their loans, such as the level of exports relative to debt service in the developing countries where the borrowers are located. For some, this means restricted access to external financing. We detect possible evidence of lenders exploiting their market power. Certain banks appear to charge a premium to change initially agreed loan terms. Furthermore, discounts are granted on developing country loans provided by small groups or clubs of relationship banks rather than on facilities with the participation of a large number of institutions.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 July 2003', 'title': 'Developing country economic structure and the pricing of syndicated credits ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work132.htm', 'author': 'Yener Altunbas, Blaise Gadanecz', 'keyword': 'syndicated loans, developing countries, debt', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work132.pdf'}

When supervisors have imperfect information about the soundness of banks, they may be unaware of insolvency problems that develop in the interval between on-site examinations. Supervising banks more often will alleviate this problem but will increase the costs of supervision. This paper analyzes the trade-offs that supervisors face between the cost of supervision and their need to monitor banks effectively. We first characterize the optimal supervisory policy, in terms of the time between examinations and the closure rule at examinations, and compare it with the policy of an independent supervisor. We then show that making this supervisor accountable for deposit insurance losses in general reduces the excessive forbearance of the independent supervisor and may also improve on the time between examinations. Finally, we extend our analysis to the impact of depositor-preference laws on supervisors' monitoring incentives and show that these laws may lead to conflicting effects on the time between examinations and closure policy vis-à-vis the social optimum.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 March 2003', 'title': 'Optimal supervisory policies and depositor-preference laws ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work131.htm', 'author': 'Henri Pagès, João Santos', 'keyword': 'Deposit Insurance, Depositor Preference, Supervision', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work131.pdf'}

<p>This overview paper examines two main issues. The first is why the exchange rate matters, especially for emerging market economies. The second is under what circumstances and how countries have dealt with the challenges posed by the exchange rate in recent years in the context of inflation targeting. We find that emerging market economies, being more exposed to the influence of the exchange rate, are likely to accord the exchange rate a bigger role in policy assessment and decision-making. However, even with the greater emphasis on the exchange rate, the emerging market economies under review have not attended to the exchange rate in a manner that contradicted their announced inflation commitments. Furthermore, recent experience shows that having to keep an eye on the exchange rate is also a fact of life in industrial economies, inflation targeting or not.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '05 February 2003', 'title': 'Living with flexible exchange rates: issues and recent experience in inflation targeting emerging market economies', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work130.htm', 'author': 'Robert N McCauley, Corrinne Ho', 'keyword': 'monetary policy, inflation targeting, exchange rate, intervention, capital controls', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work130.pdf'}

Our analysis is based on a model of ratings determination that takes into account factors that measure the business and financial risks of firms, in addition to indicators of macroeconomic conditions. Utilising annual data on all US firms rated by Standard &amp; Poor's, we find little evidence of procyclicality in ratings. By contrast, we find that initial ratings and rating changes exhibit excess sensitivity to the business cycle.

<p>This paper reviews the challenges faced by central banks in recent years in order to evaluate their policy implications going forward. To highlight the genuine uncertainty surrounding the lessons to be drawn, the paper examines recent experience through two intentionally polarised perspectives, viz. the "continuity" and "new-environment" views. These perspectives lead to somewhat different conclusions regarding the nature of the challenges central banks are likely to face in the current economic landscape and the policy responses that may be appropriate. While the continuity view stresses the reliability of traditional policy benchmarks, the newenvironment view suggests that it may be worth considering assigning greater weight to the build-up of financial imbalances when calibrating policy. Such an approach could be consistent with current policy frameworks, but it would point to a somewhat longer horizon for evaluating policy alternatives as well as greater attention to the balance of risks to the outlook.</p>

We survey both academic and proprietary models to examine how macroeconomic and systematic risk effects are incorporated into measures of credit risk exposure.

Stylised facts suggest that bank lending behaviour is highly procyclical. We offer a new hypothesis that may help explain why this occurs. The institutional memory hypothesis is driven by deterioration in the ability of loan officers over the bank.s lending cycle that results in an easing of credit standards. This easing of standards may be compounded by simultaneous deterioration in the capacity of bank management to discipline its loan officers and reduction in the capacities of external stakeholders to discipline bank management. We test the empirical implications of this hypothesis using data from individual US banks over the period 1980-2000. We employ over 200,000 observations on commercial loan growth measured at the bank level, over 2,000,000 observations on interest rate premiums on individual loans, and over 2,000 observations on credit standards and bank-level loan spreads from bank management survey responses. The empirical analysis provides support for the hypothesis.

This paper proposes a continuous-time framework that explains some stylised facts in recent "twin crises" episodes. I show that access to the world capital market enables the domestic economy to achieve a more efficient allocation of resources. However, the banking sector becomes more fragile when this international borrowing is wealth-constrained. A temporary shock is amplified and becomes persistent due to the interaction between the value of bank assets and the borrowing constraint. Depending on the exchange rate regime arrangement and the policy of the central bank, this financial fragility can evolve into a banking crisis, a currency crisis, or the simultaneous occurrence of both.				</div>, 'publishdata': '06 January 2003', 'title': 'Credit constraints, financial liberalisation and twin crises ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work124.htm', 'author': 'Haibin Zhu', 'keyword': 'currency crises, borrowing constraint, banking crises', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work124.pdf'}

Recent trends toward greater central bank independence and the adoption of formal inflation targeting by several countries have served to emphasise the importance of communication policy. In this paper, we explore some of the economic effects of public information that arise whenever public information serves the dual role of conveying fundamental information as well as serving as a focal point for better coordination. More precise public information is a double-edged tool. While it is very effective in influencing actions through coordination, sometimes it can be too effective, and coordinate actions away from fundamentals.				</div>, 'publishdata': '05 January 2003', 'title': 'Communication and monetary policy ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work123.htm', 'author': 'Jeffery Amato, Stephen Morris, Hyun Song Shin', 'keyword': 'Communication and monetary policy', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work123.pdf'}

A vector autoregression is estimated on tick-by-tick data for quote-changes and signed trades of two-year, five-year and 10-year on-the-run US Treasury notes. Confirming the results found by Hasbrouck (1991) and others for the stock market, signed order flow tends to exert a strong effect on prices. More interestingly, however, there is often a strong effect in the opposite direction, particularly at times of volatile trading. Price declines elicit sales and price increases elicit purchases. An examination of tick-by-tick trading on an especially volatile day confirms this finding. At least in the US Treasury market, trades and price movements appear likely to exhibit positive feedback at short horizons, particularly during periods of market stress. This suggests that the standard analytical approach to the microstructure of financial markets, which focuses on the ways in which the information possessed by informed traders becomes incorporated into market prices through order flow, should be complemented by an account of how price changes affect trading decisions.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 January 2003', 'title': 'Positive feedback trading under stress: Evidence from the US Treasury securities market ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work122.htm', 'author': 'Benjamin H Cohen, Hyun Song Shin', 'keyword': 'Treasury bond market, positive feedback, market microstructure', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work122.pdf'}

We study the implications for optimal monetary policy of introducing habit formation in consumption into a general equilibrium model with sticky prices. Habit formation affects the model's endogenous dynamics through its effects on both aggregate demand and households' supply of output. We show that the objective of monetary policy consistent with welfare maximisation includes output stablisation, as well as inflation and output gap stablisation. We find that the variance of output increases under optimal policy, even though it acquires a higher implicit weight in the welfare function. We also find that a simple interest rate rule nearly achieves the welfare-optimal allocation, regardless of the degree of habit formation. In this rule, the optimal responses to inflation and the lagged interest rate are both declining in the size of the habit, although super-inertial policies remain optimal.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 November 2002', 'title': 'Implications of habit formation for optimal monetary policy ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work121.htm', 'author': 'Jeffery Amato, Thomas Laubach', 'keyword': 'interest rate rules, habit formation, optimal monetary policy', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work121.pdf'}

<p>In recent years, a number of structural developments have had a significant influence on the functioning of financial markets. The most important of these developments are the introduction of the euro, the spread of electronic trading, shifts in the constellation and behaviour of market participants and changes in relative supplies of different assets. There is some evidence that such developments have led to shifts in liquidity among different market segments and, moreover, that market liquidity is less robust than in the past. Furthermore, some of the largest government securities markets have begun to lose their pre-eminence as centres for price discovery about macroeconomic fundamentals, while credit derivative, corporate bond and equity markets are all vying to become the locus for price discovery about credit risk. These changes in market functioning pose various challenges for central bank policy, including what role central banks should play in promoting robust liquidity, how best to gauge market expectations, and whether the conduct of monetary policy operations should be adjusted.

In this paper, a VAR model is used to study the effects of monetary policy shocks in seven East Asian economies. For each economy, the same identification scheme is imposed and the dynamic responses to a monetary shock are examined in the light of the predictions of monetary theory. The results suggest that the VAR model produces sensible impulse response functions for most of the economies, especially for the sample that ends before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Given the openness of these economies, the exchange rate plays a significant role in the formulation of monetary policy. In order to capture explicitly the importance of the exchange rate in these economies, plausible weights are also imposed on the exchange rate to identify the model.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 September 2002', 'title': 'A VAR analysis of the effects of monetary policy in East Asia', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work119.htm', 'author': 'Ben S C Fung', 'keyword': 'VAR, monetary policy shocks, East Asia', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work119.pdf'}

We study empirically the effect of focus (specialization) vs. diversification on the return and the risk of banks using data from 105 Italian banks over the period 1993-1999. Specifically, we analyze the tradeoffs between (loan portfolio) focus and diversification using a unique data set that is able to identify individual bank loan exposures to different industries, to different sectors, and to different geographical regions. Our results are consistent with a theory that predicts a deterioration in bank monitoring quality at high levels of risk and a deterioration in bank monitoring quality upon lending expansion into newer or competitive industries. Our most important findings are that industrial loan diversification reduces bank return while endogenously producing riskier loans for all banks in our sample (this effect being most powerful for high risk banks), sectoral loan diversification produces an inefficient risk-return tradeoff only for high risk banks, and geographical diversification results in an improvement in the risk-return tradeoff for banks with low levels of risk. A robust result that emerges from our empirical findings is that diversification of bank assets is not guaranteed to produce superior performance and/or greater safety for banks.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 September 2002', 'title': 'Should banks be diversified?

The concept of risk-based capital requirements enjoys widespread support. Effective implementation, however, requires that risk be measured accurately both across borrowers and across time. Under the New Capital Accord, the cornerstone of this risk measurement process is the rating of the borrower. In this paper we use the ratings assigned by individual Mexican banks to examine how measured credit risk for these banks has changed since the financial crisis in the mid-1990s. We then examine the implications of these changes in risk for regulatory capital under the proposed changes to the Basel Capital Accord. We find that measured risk increased after the crisis and then fell as the recovery took hold. In turn, despite the limitations of the data, we find that the proposed internal ratings-based approach would have generated large swings in regulatory capital requirements over the second half of the 1990s, with required capital increasing significantly in the aftermath of the crisis, and then falling as the economy recovered. Looking forward, if movements in actual bank capital were to show this same cyclical variation, then business cycle fluctuations might be amplified by developments in the banking industry.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 September 2002', 'title': 'Internal ratings, the business cycle and capital requirements: some evidence from an emerging market economy', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work117.htm', 'author': 'Philip Lowe, Miguel Segoviano', 'keyword': 'risk-based capital requirements, New Capital Accord, rating of the borrower', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work117.pdf'}

This paper examines the two-way linkages between credit risk measurement and the macroeconomy. It first discusses the issue of whether credit risk is low or high in economic booms. It then reviews how macroeconomic considerations are incorporated into credit risk models and the risk measurement approach that underlies the New Basel Capital Accord. Finally, it asks what effect these measurement approaches are likely to have on the macroeconomy, particularly through their role in influencing the level of bank capital. The paper argues that much remains to be done in integrating macroeconomic considerations into risk measurement, particularly during the upswing of business cycles that are characterised by rapid increases in credit and asset prices. It also suggests that a system of risk-based capital requirements is likely to deliver large changes in minimum requirements over the business cycle, particularly if risk measurement is based on market prices. This has the potential to increase the financial amplification of business cycles, although other aspects of risk-based capital requirements are likely to work in the other direction. Further work on evaluating the net effects is important for both supervisory and monetary authorities.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 September 2002', 'title': 'Credit risk measurement and procyclicality', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work116.htm', 'author': 'Philip Lowe', 'keyword': 'credit risk measurement, macroeconomy', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work116.pdf'}

<p>To address the banking system's non-performing loan (NPL) problem, the Chinese government set up four asset management corporations (AMCs). They were to buy up bad debts of the big four state-owned commercial banks and dispose of them over 10 years, taking a large step towards NPL resolution. But in their first two years, these AMCs have made only a limited contribution to resolution of the NPL problem. They have taken over less than half of the NPLs at the big four banks. In addition, while AMC financing have been less than transparent, it appears to have burdened The People's Bank of China (PBoC) with greater risks to date than the Ministry of Finance (MoF), although there have not been to date any evident monetary consequences. Under plausible recovery scenarios, the AMC losses would surpass the current financial contributions to the AMCs from both the MoF and the PBoC. Since their cash recoveries have lagged their interest obligations, the AMCs face rising cash flow pressure. In response, the government is pushing for speedier asset recovery, as evident in the milestone of the first international NPL auction.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 August 2002', 'title': "China's asset management corporations", 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work115.htm', 'author': 'Guonan Ma, Ben S C Fung', 'keyword': 'China, banking, non-performing loans, asset management companies', 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work115.pdf'}

This paper argues that financial imbalances can build up in a low inflation environment and that in some circumstances it is appropriate for policy to respond to contain these imbalances. While identifying financial imbalances ex ante can be difficult, this paper presents empirical evidence that it is not impossible. In particular, sustained rapid credit growth combined with large increases in asset prices appears to increase the probability of an episode of financial instability. The paper also argues that while low and stable inflation promotes financial stability, it also increases the likelihood that excess demand pressures show up first in credit aggregates and asset prices, rather than in goods and services prices. Accordingly, in some situations, a monetary response to credit and asset markets may be appropriate to preserve both financial and monetary stability.

This paper analyses the impact of various assumptions about the association between aggregate default probabilities and the loss given default on bank loans and corporate bonds, and seeks to empirically explain this critical relationship. Moreover, it simulates the effects of this relationship on the procyclicality of mandatory capital requirements like those proposed in 2001 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. We present the analysis and results in four distinct sections. The first section examines the literature of the last three decades of the various structural-form, closed-form and other credit risk and portfolio credit value-at-risk (VaR) models and the way they explicitly or implicitly treat the recovery rate variable. Section 2 presents simulation results under three different recovery rate scenarios and examines the impact of these scenarios on the resulting risk measures: our results show a significant increase in both expected an unexpected losses when recovery rates are stochastic and and negatively correlated with default probabilities. In Section 3, we empirically examine the recovery rates on corporate bond defaults, over the period 1982-2000. We attempt to explain recovery rates by specifying a rather straightforward statistical least squares regression model. The central thesis is that aggregate recovery rates are basically a function of supply and demand for the securities. Our econometric univariate and multivariate time series models explain a significant portion of the variance in bond recovery rates aggregated across all seniority and collateral levels. Finally, in Section 4 we analyse how the link between default probability and recovery risk would affect the procyclicality effects of the New Basel Capital Accord, due to be released in 2002. We see that, if banks are let free to use their own estimates of LGD (as in the "advanced" IRB approach), an increase in their sensitivity to economic cycles would follow. Our results have important implications for just about all portfolio credit risk models, for markets which depend on recovery rates as a key variable (eg securitisations, credit derivatives, etc), for the current debate on the revised BIS guidelines for capital requirements on bank credit assets, and for investors in corporate bonds of all credit qualities.

This paper analyses the determinants of international bank lending to the largest countries in Asia and Latin America through a framework based on "push"/"pull" factors. Our results show that both types of factors determine international bank lending. However, they differ from those of the early 1990s' literature in that aggregate lending to emerging market countries appears to have been procyclical to growth in lending countries rather than countercyclical. Moreover, the sharp increase in short-term lending during the 1990s seems to have been largely a pull phenomenon. Additionally, there is evidence that fixed rate regimes encouraged international bank lending, while bandwagon and contagion effects were also present. The introduction of the Basel Accord on capital adequacy does not appear to have played a significant role in international bank lending to emerging economies.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 June 2002', 'title': 'Determinants of international bank lending to emerging market countries ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work112.htm', 'author': 'Serge Jeanneau, Marian Micu', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work112.pdf'}

Both financial and non-financial firms routinely implement hedging policies to mitigate their exposure to changes in asset prices. However, while these policies may perform satisfactorily in the limited sense of hedging the exposure under consideration, they might increase the overall likelihood of financial distress due to the liquidity risks that they create. This paper examines the case of hedging price risk using derivative contracts that are marked to market (such as futures contracts) and hence subject to margin calls. It is shown that liquidity risk, stemming from the need to meet margin calls on the futures position, can be a significant source of risk and can even lead to financial distress even though the firm remains "hedged". Such risks should therefore be taken into account in the formulation of an optimal hedging policy. This paper derives the dynamic hedging strategy of a firm that uses futures contracts to hedge a spot market exposure. The risk emanating from the margin requirement on futures contracts is incorporated into the hedging decision by restricting the borrowing capacity of the firm. It is shown that this leads to a substantial reduction in the firm's optimal hedge, especially if the hedging horizon is long. The results provide theoretical support for the low level of hedging observed empirically.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 January 2002', 'title': 'Optimal dynamic hedging using futures under a borrowing constraint ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work109.htm', 'author': 'Akash Deep', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work109.pdf'}

Episodes of boom and bust in credit markets have often coincided with cycles in economic activity and property markets. The coincidence of these cycles has already been widely documented in the literature, but few studies address the issue in a formal way. In this study we analyse the determinants of credit to the private non-bank sector in 16 industrialised countries since 1980 based on a cointegrating VAR. Cointegration tests suggest that the long-run development of credit cannot be explained by standard credit demand factors. But once real property prices, measured as a weighted average of real residential and real commercial property prices, are added to the system, we are able to identify long-run relationships linking real credit positively to real GDP and real property prices and negatively to the real interest rate. These long-run relationships may be interpreted as long-run extended credit demand relationships, but we may also capture effects on credit supply. Impulse response analysis based on a standard Cholesky decomposition reveals that there is significant two-way dynamic interaction between bank credit and property prices. We also find that innovations to the short-term real interest rate have a strong and significant negative effect on bank credit, GDP and property prices.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 December 2001', 'title': 'The determinants of private sector credit in industrialised countries: do property prices matter?

By assuming that depositors make their withdrawal decisions sequentially, the model provides an equilibrium-selection mechanism in the economy. A bank run would occur if and only if depositors perceive a low return on bank assets. Furthermore, a panic situation arises only when the market information is imperfect.

Bank regulation in most countries encompasses a lender of last resort, deposit insurance and supervision. These functions are interrelated and therefore require coordination among the authorities responsible for them. These authorities, however, are often established with different mandates, some of which are likely to be in conflict. We consider these issues by studying the optimal institutional allocation of such functions. 
<p>We find that a single regulator will lead to insufficient bank monitoring and suboptimal bank investment in loans. It may also lead to too much forbearance. We consider alternative structures to deal with the problem of excess forbearance both in a full information setting and in settings with asymmetry of information between regulators. We show in the former setting that if it is feasible to prespecify the rates on lending of last resort, then it is useful to make this function the exclusive province of one regulator. By giving the deposit insurer the authority to close banks and by having last resort lending insured, one gives the deposit insurer strong incentives against forbearance. If it is not possible to pre-specify such rates, then a useful arrangement is to have both the central bank and the deposit insurer acting as lenders of last resort. In this structure it is important for the last resort lending to be uninsured in order to reduce temptation to overlend, although this somewhat increases the deposit insurer's temptation to forbear. </p>
<p>The final section of the paper analyses asymmetry of information between regulators. We show that regulators may have an incentive not to share gathered information. Since some regulators find it easier to collect particular information, this result suggests that it is important to consider informational advantages in the allocation of bank regulation.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 August 2001', 'title': 'Allocating bank regulatory powers: lender of last resort, deposit insurance and supervision ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work102.htm', 'author': 'Charles Kahn, João Santos', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work102.pdf'}

On the lender side, banks and investors in fixed income markets have become more focused on the characteristics of individual borrowers rather than the nationality of the issuer and have built up expertise to evaluate credit risk. European equity markets have also been affected by the enhanced ability of investors to build strategies with a pan-European perspective as prices increasingly reflected risk factors specific to industrial sectors rather than individual countries. On the borrower side, EMU has increased the attractiveness of market-based financing methods by allowing debt issuers to tap institutional portfolios across the euro area. Lower barriers to cross-border financial transactions have also increased the contestability of the market for financial services, be it at the wholesale or the retail level. 
<p>The introduction of the euro has also highlighted the shortcomings of existing institutional structures and areas where excessive focus on narrowly defined interests may stand in the way of realising the full potential benefits from the new environment. Diverging legal and institutional infrastructures and market practices can impede further financial market development and deepening. Hence, the euro has put a premium on cooperation between national authorities and institution as a means of achieving a more harmonised financial environment. </p>

The autumn of 1998 provides a setting in which to test the performance of the interbank market during a potential financial crisis. This period witnessed Russia's effective default on its sovereign bonds and the near collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. Despite these negative shocks to bank capital and increased uncertainty in financial markets more generally, the federal funds market still effectively channeled liquidity to those institutions in need at rates consistent with Federal Reserve intentions. Further, risk premiums on overnight lending were largely unaffected and lending volumes increased, suggesting that the federal funds market performed well during this period.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 June 2001', 'title': 'The interbank market during a crisis ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work99.htm', 'author': 'Craig Furfine', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work99.pdf'}

<p>This paper studies the relationship between inflation, output, money and interest rates in the euro area, using data spanning 1980-2000. The P model is shown to have considerable empirical support. Thus, the "price gap" or, equivalently, the "real money gap" (the gap between current real balances and long-run equilibrium real balances), has substantial predictive power for future inflation. The real money gap contains more information about future inflation than the output gap and the Eurosystem's money-growth indicator (the gap between current M3 growth and a reference value). The results suggest that the Eurosystem's money-growth indicator is an inferior indicator of future inflation.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '04 January 2001', 'title': 'Money and inflation in the Euro Area: A case for monetary indicators?

A salient feature of the Asian crisis of 1997 was a collapse of stock markets that took place over several months. The dynamics of this collapse raises the question of what information was driving the markets. This paper examines a key aspect of this question: did information flow from the domestic Asian markets to overseas markets, or vice versa? We test for the direction of this information flow by comparing daily returns in several Southeast Asian equity markets with daily returns on US-based closed-end funds that invest in those markets, exploiting the fact that there is no overlap between the trading hours in the two regions. We find that while information flows between local and US markets tended to be roughly evenly balanced before the crisis, US market returns assumed a more important role during the crisis. This is the case both for the level of daily returns and for the volatility of those returns. We also find that fund returns were more closely tied to broad US market returns during the crisis period. This suggests that the shift in causation between the US and Asia reflected a greater role for US market sentiment, rather than for the news that became known during US trading hours.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 December 2000', 'title': 'Information flows during the asian crisis: evidence from closed-end funds ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work97.htm', 'author': 'Benjamin H Cohen, Eli M Remolona', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work97.pdf'}

Data on monetary aggregates are subject to periodic redefinitions, presumably in part to improve their link to measures of output. Money data are also revised on a regular basis. Taking these data imperfections into account, we reassess the evidence on the marginal predictive content of M1 and m2 for real and nominal output. In particular, by first using the latest version of the data that is available, and then using sequences of historical time series that would have been available to forecasters in real-time, we are able to provide a comprehensive assessment of whether money is useful for predicting output. We conclude that the generally significant marginal predictive content of M1 and m2 for output that is found using a recently revised data set is not duplicated in a real-time setting, although M2 is shown to remain useful when 1-year ahead forecasts are constructed using fitted vector autoregressive models.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 December 2000', 'title': 'The real-time predictive content of money for output ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work96.htm', 'author': 'Jeffery Amato, Norman Swanson', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work96.pdf'}

Quite an impressive amount of recent academic research focuses on the idea that financial factors may cause or reinforce real fluctuations. In these models, it is typically a monetary policy shock that serves to lower the value of an asset which is used to secure a firm's borrowing, thereby generating broad credit channel effects of monetary transmission. We empirically investigate the impact of corporate risk management strategies on this specific transmission channel by using the seminal paper of Gertler and Gilchrist (1994) as a benchmark. A potentially important impact of corporate hedging is suggested by corporate finance models that generate hedge incentives by introducing asymmetric information into the credit markets, the assumption at the very heart of the available theories of a broad credit channel. The advent of liquid US interest rate derivatives markets in the mid-1970s should, therefore, serve as something like a turning point in the history of US monetary transmission. Credit channel effects should have been in operation prior to the introduction of these markets, while any such effect should have tended to vanish afterwards. In addition, we should be able to detect marked differences in the behaviour of small and large firms up to the 1970s in contrast to a broadly identical behaviour on the part of these firms in the period thereafter.

This complementary paper to Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993) seeks to explore some of the corporate finance foundations of monetary economics. In particular, we investigate the impact of corporate risk management strategies on the monetary transmission mechanism. We employ a simple model of a financial accelerator (synonymously: a broad credit channel of monetary policy transmission) to argue that information asymmetries - which are at the heart of these models of the transmission mechanism - create incentives for corporate hedging programmes, that is, cash flow management. These policies, in turn, diminish the impact of monetary policy measures, which is reduced to the pure cost-of-capital effect.

This paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between trading volumes, volatility and bid-ask spreads in foreign exchange markets. It uses a new data set that includes daily data on trading volumes for the dollar exchange rates of seven currencies from emerging market countries. The sample period is 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1999. The results are broadly consistent with the findings of the literature that used futures volumes as proxies for total foreign exchange trading. I find that in most cases unexpected trading volumes and volatility are positively correlated, suggesting that both are driven by the arrival of public information, as predicted by the mixture of distributions hypothesis. I also find that the correlation between trading volumes and volatility is positive during "normal" periods but turns negative when volatility increases sharply. Finally, the results suggest that volatility and spreads are positively correlated, as suggested by inventory cost models. However, contrary to the prediction of these models, I do not find evidence of a significant impact of unexpected trading volumes on spreads.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 October 2000', 'title': 'Trading volumes, volatility and spreads in foreign exchange markets: evidence from emerging market countries ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work93.htm', 'author': 'Gabriele Galati', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work93.pdf'}

Various suggestions for achieving the second objective are then critically evaluated. While most seem to have merit, no single suggestion would seem sufficient in itself to avoid all problems.

A survey of the literature suggests financial crises are typically preceded by overvalued exchange rates, inadequate international reserves, recessions and excessive credit growth. These indicators and others, such as short-term external debt, which appear more important in recent crises are included in the summary indices of vulnerability.

This article analyses the welfare consequences of delegating to the central bank the task of minimising deviations of forecasts of goal variables from their target values. The delegated objectives considered in this article are motivated by the observation that central banks oftentimes operate under objectives which do not necessarily represent society's preferences. The analysis is performed using an estimated model of optimising households and firms that generates tradeoffs between stabilising wage and price inflation and the output gap. We find that when the central bank's objective is defined solely in terms of price inflation, it is welfare optimal to stabilise only those fluctuations in price inflation that are forecastable at least five quarters ahead. On the other hand, when the central bank's objective involves both wage and price inflation stabilisation, the central bank should stabilise all fluctuations in these variables, not just those forecastable at some horizon.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 August 2000', 'title': 'Forecast-based monetary policy ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work89.htm', 'author': 'Jeffery Amato, Thomas Laubach', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work89.pdf'}

This paper develops a structural, dynamic model of a banking firm to analyse how banks adjust their loan portfolios over time. In the model, banks experience capital shocks, face uncertain future loan demand, and incur costs based on their proximity to regulatory minimum capital requirements. Non-linear relationships between bank capital levels and lending are derived from the model, and key parameters are estimated using panel data on large US commercial banks operating continuously between December 1989 and December 1997. Using the estimated model, the optimal bank response to changes in capital requirements, shocks to bank capital, and changes to bank loan demand is simulated. The simulations predict that increases in risk-based and leverage capital requirements, negative capital shocks, or a decline in loan demand cause a reduction in loan growth. Nevertheless, by calculating the optimal portfolio response to these various changes, it is shown that changes in capital regulation are a necessary ingredient to explain the decline in loan growth and the rise in bank capital ratios witnessed nearly a decade ago. Thus, this study suggests that the current effort to redesign bank capital requirements should work under the assumption that banks will optimally respond to the economic incentives found in the regulation.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 June 2000', 'title': 'Evidence on the response of US banks to changes in capital requirements ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work88.htm', 'author': 'Craig Furfine', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work88.pdf'}

This paper serves two purposes. First, it provides estimates of an optimisation-based equilibrium model with sticky prices and wages. Second, the estimated model is used to analyse the welfare properties of various interest rate rules for conducting monetary policy. As shown by Erceg et al (1999), an important feature of this model is that it involves a trade-off between the variances of price and wage inflation and the output gap. This trade-off implies that it is desirable for the monetary authority to respond to more than inflation, output and past interest rates when setting the current interest rate. Indeed, the welfare optimal policy can be approximated with responses to both price and wage inflation and the past interest rate. By contrast, rules that call for a strong response to either detrended output or the output gap result in much lower level of welfare.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 May 2000', 'title': 'Monetary policy in an estimated optimisation-based model with sticky prices and wages ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work87.htm', 'author': 'Jeffery Amato, Thomas Laubach', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work87.pdf'}

This paper considers the functioning of the international interbank market (IIBM), its contribution to the recent financial turbulence in Asia, and the policy issues presented by the existence of moral hazard and implicit guarantees of interbank liabilities. The paper provides statistical analysis to document the existence of contagion in the interbank market. While previous researchers had cautioned of the possibility of contagion in the IIBM, statistical support for its existence was relatively sparse. Within geographic regions, interbank market contagion appears much more prevalent within Asia than within Latin America. Between regions, the contagion appears to have been from Asia to Latin America. The paper discusses the possible role of implicit government guarantees of international interbank credit in contributing to inflows into emerging market countries, where significant information asymmetries made difficult the analysis of counterpart risk. It is argued that because of the serious informational problems in some segments of the international interbank system, the market is subject to potential disruption. The implicit guarantees given to risky borrowers in the IIBM can be thought of as a subsidy which helps to ensure the viability of the market. In principle, it is similar to a subsidy that is provided a market with extreme adverse selection problems. It can, however, also be a source of instability if not properly managed.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 March 2000', 'title': 'Information, liquidity and risk in the international interbank market: implicit guarantees and private credit market failure ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work86.htm', 'author': 'Henri J Bernard, Joseph Bisignano', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work86.pdf'}

This paper re-examines the empirical content of the expectations theory of the term structure by employing the Campbell-Shiller (1987) methodology to study the behaviour of 10-year/three-month US government yield spreads. The methodology is implemented in two ways. First, theoretical spreads satisfying the expectations theory are constructed from in-sample forecasts of future changes in short rates generated from a small-scale VAR. Second, theoretical spreads are computed from out-of-sample forecasts of changes in short rates with the parameters of each VAR equation updated with a Bayesian procedure. When the procedure is restricted to give less weight to new data than would be the case with OLS estimation over an expanding sample, theoretical spreads computed from out-of-sample forecasts track actual spreads closely in pre-1979 data. This is also the case as from the start of 1984 if data from the 1979Q4-1982Q4 period of non-borrowed reserve targeting are given zero weight when estimating the parameters of the VAR.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 January 2000', 'title': 'A defence of the expectations theory as a model of us long-term interest rates ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work85.htm', 'author': 'Gregory Sutton', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work85.pdf'}

Our results show that the majority of firms borrow for the first time from a single bank, but soon afterwards some of them start borrowing from several banks. Duration analysis shows that the likelihood of a firm substituting a single with multiple relationships increases with the duration of the single relationship and that firms with more growth opportunities and more bank debt are more likely to initiate multiple relationships. Firms with poor performance, too, are more likely to initiate multiple relationships. The analysis of the ex post effects of the initiation of multiple relationships does not detect an increase in the firm's overall indebtedness and investment, but it finds an increase in its trade credit reliance and no improvement in its performance. Overall these results suggest to us that a potential unwillingness by the incumbent bank to increase its exposure to a firm because of its past poor performance appears to explain better firms' decision to initiate multiple relationships than the hypothesis that they do so to protect themselves against the hold-up rents inherent to exclusive relationships because they have many growth opportunities.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 January 2000', 'title': 'Switching from single to multiple bank lending relationships: determinants and implications ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work83.htm', 'author': 'Luísa Farinha, João Santos', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work83.pdf'}

The focus of monetary policy has shifted markedly over the past 15 years away from attempts to fine tune the economy towards the longer-run goal of attaining price stability and creating the necessary conditions for sustainable economic growth. In an attempt to minimise the costs of such a transition, central banks have become more independent and monetary policy more transparent, changes intended to increase the credibility of monetary policy and to reduce short-run sacrifice ratios. However, concerns have been expressed that an environment of price stability and independent central banks may instead lead to higher sacrifice ratios and, perhaps, even higher rates of structural unemployment, because of the increased importance of nominal and real rigidities at low rates of inflation. 
<p> The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether there are any grounds for such concerns. We do so by estimating sacrifice ratios for 19 industrialised countries, using three alternative approaches: (1) estimating aggregate supply curves; (2) estimating structural price and wage equations; and (3) comparing actual changes in inflation with changes in standard measures of output and labour market slack. The empirical evidence shows that, as the average rate of inflation for the 19 countries in our sample has fallen from 8% to 3½%, the average sacrifice ratio has increased from around 1.5 to about 2.5. Although sacrifice ratios appear to have risen in virtually all countries, the increases tend to be smallest in those that have adopted measures to deregulate labour and product markets and in countries where the central bank has adopted explicit inflation targets. However, the empirical evidence also reveals that point estimates of the sacrifice ratios for individual countries are quite sensitive to the econometric method adopted. This last result suggests that identification of the sources of higher sacrifice ratios remains elusive and thus that one should be cautious about drawing strong implications for monetary policy from these kinds of estimates. </p> </div>, 'publishdata': '04 November 1999', 'title': 'Sacrifice ratios and the conduct of monetary policy in conditions of low inflation ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work82.htm', 'author': 'Palle S Andersen, William Wascher', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work82.pdf'}

The purpose of this note is to derive measures of ex ante long-term real interest rates that satisfy Fisher's notion of a long-run relationship between expectations of inflation and nominal interest rates. We do so by adopting a backward-looking approach that also takes account of the increasing integration of financial markets by allowing for global influences on national bond rates. The results point to long memories in the inflation formation process as well as to significant international linkages. Moreover, once these effects are allowed for, expectations of inflation and long-term bond rates appear to be cointegrated with cointegration vectors of unity. However, whether the measures derived provide better estimates of agents' actual perceptions of ex ante real rates than those commonly used remains to be seen, as we do not test their forecasting ability.

This paper examines the impact of exchange rates and import prices on domestic PPI and CPI in selected industrialised economies. The empirical model is a VAR incorporating a distribution chain of pricing. Impulse responses and variance decompositions indicate that these external factors have a modest effect on domestic price inflation over the post-Bretton Woods era. The pass-through is somewhat stronger in countries with a larger import share. A historical decomposition over 1996-98 indicates, however, that external factors have had a sizable disinflationary effect in most of the countries during the past couple of years. Estimating the model using post-1982 data has little effect on these conclusions.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 November 1999', 'title': 'Pass-through of exchange rates and import prices to domestic inflation in some industrialised economies ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work79.htm', 'author': 'J.

Bringing a non-financial firm into a banking conglomerate may be advantageous because it may make it easier for the bank to dispose of assets seized in a loan default. The internal market formed inside the banking and commerce conglomerate increases the liquidity of such assets and improves the bank's ability to perform financial intermediation. More generally, owning a non-financial firm may act either as a substitute or a complement to commercial lending. In some cases, a bank will voluntarily refrain from making loans, choosing to become a non-bank bank in an unregulated environment.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 October 1999', 'title': 'Banking and commerce: a liquidity approach ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work78.htm', 'author': 'Joseph Haubrich, João Santos', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work78.pdf'}

This paper provides a quantitative framework for choosing the composition of reserve currencies. Assuming that the central bank's performance objectives are defined in terms of ex post returns in different currency numeraires, the currency allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem. The advantage of the proposed methodology is that it does not require any explicit assumptions about the risk preferences of the central bank or knowledge of the currency numeraire. Using some proxy values for the possible range of ex post returns measured in different currency numeraires, the study shows how the currency allocation problem can be solved. In particular, the proposed method borrows the concept of the degree of satisfaction from fuzzy decision theory and maximises such a function defined on the least favourable return outcome. In this sense, the proposed method differs from standard utility-based approaches which look for solutions that are best on average. The results of the study indicate that central banks on average are dollar-based investors on the basis of current allocations. Further, the study also indicates that if central banks consider an ex post return profile that safeguards the purchasing power of the reserves, then the currency distribution of reserves should more closely resemble the SDR basket.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 August 1999', 'title': 'Reserve currency allocation: an alternative methodology ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work72.htm', 'author': 'Srichander Ramaswamy', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work72.pdf'}

We analyse high-frequency responses of the US yield curve to macroeconomic announcements, exploiting the high signal-to-noise ratios of these events. Surprises in the announcements evoke relatively weak reactions from the short maturities and the strong ones from the intermediate maturities. Thus the term structure of announcement effects is hump-shaped. We fit an affine-yield model to the yield changes, using the announcement surprises as instruments for the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM). The model estimates imply that the announcements impose larger shocks on an expected future target interest rate than on the current short-term interest rate and that different types of announcements generate different expectations about this target rate, how rapidly it will be approached, and how long it will be maintained.

This paper studies the macroeconomic relevance of credit channels of monetary policy by examining the impact of the external finance premium (EFP), that may vary over the business cycle, on private consumption in Europe. A consumption model incorporates credit channels by assuming that liquidity-constrained consumers not only use current income for financing their consumption, but also external finance, which availability depends on the EFP. The empirical analysis shows an accelerator effect of the EFP on consumption for Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. In contrast, for France, the United Kingdom and Belgium no evidence in favour of this financial propagation mechanism has been found.

This paper develops measures of emerging market credit spreads for the 1990s, based on data on new bond issues and bank loans, that cover a broader range of borrowers than the Brady bond spreads most commonly used to date. These measures are used to identify the impacts of credit ratings, maturity and currency denomination on spreads. We find important regional differences in spreads across the developing world, even after controlling for risk and maturity. We also identify the evolution of spreads during the 1990s up until the advent of the Asian financial crisis, holding other determinants constant, and find that emerging market spreads declined by more than can be explained by improvements in risk. However, for emerging market instruments with relatively favourable credit ratings, trends in spreads differed considerably from those experienced by Brady bonds. Finally, and in contrast to much market commentary, we find that variations in industrial country short-term interest rates explain relatively little of the decline in emerging market bond spreads. Longer-term trends, perhaps reflecting globalisation, along with the temporary impact of the Mexican financial crisis, may have been more important factors in the behaviour of emerging market spreads.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 May 1999', 'title': 'The evolution and determinants of emerging markets credit spreads in the 1990s ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work68.htm', 'author': 'Steven Kamin, Karsten von Kleist', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work68.pdf'}

There is a growing recognition in the literature on business cycles that production technologies may give rise to complicated interactions between seasonal and cyclical movements in economic time series, which can distort business cycle inference based on seasonally adjusted data. For the most part, however, the empirical research in this area has relied on standard univariate seasonal adjustment techniques that provide only a partial description of such interactions. In this paper, we develop an unobserved components model that explicitly accounts for the effects of business cycles on industry-level seasonality and for the potential feedback from seasonality to the aggregate business cycle. In particular, the model extracts an aggregate "common cycle" from industry-level data, allows formal statistical testing of seasonal differences in the comovement of an industry with the common cycle, and identifies economy-wide and industry-specific contributions to the seasonal and non-seasonal variation in the data. Applying the model to quarterly US payroll employment data, we frequently find evidence of statistically significant differences across seasons in the comovement between sectoral employment and the common cycle. On the other hand, we also find that seasonal fluctuations in employment at the industry level are largely idiosyncratic and that the proportion of the total variance of the common cycle accounted for by seasonality is much less than for aggregate employment. This suggests that seasonal shocks may have less of a business cycle element to them than one might infer from the seasonal movements in aggregate variables.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 May 1999', 'title': 'The cyclical sensitivity of seasonality in US employment ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work67.htm', 'author': 'S.

Internationally integrated capital markets can have significant effects on the way central bankers pursue both monetary (macroeconomic) and financial stability. With respect to the former, countries are being pushed into corner solutions of either "immutably" fixed exchange rates or floating. While the proper choice depends on a country's circumstances, no regime is without its own problems. In this paper, some of the practical implications of floating are highlighted; in particular, how adoption of such a regime affects the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and the problems posed by volatile exchange rate expectations. As for the pursuit of financial stability, central bankers and other regulators must increasingly recognise the international dimension in their efforts to promote the health of financial institutions, financial markets and the infrastructure (legal, payment systems, etc.) which supports them. This international dimension affects the nature of the prudential policies adopted as well as the processes through which they are agreed. Finally, recognising that monetary stability and financial stability are two sides of the same coin (witness Mexico in 1995 and South Asia more recently), the paper concludes with some preliminary reflections on possible interactions between monetary and prudential policies in an internationally integrated world.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 April 1999', 'title': 'Evolving international financial markets: some implications for Central Banks ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work66.htm', 'author': 'William R White', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work66.pdf'}

From an international perspective, the European rate of unemployment has been high and growing over the last one to two decades; against this background, the parallel rise in profit shares in a number of European countries seems to be at odds with expected economic behaviour. 
<p> This paper contributes to a solution of this apparent enigma in two steps. First, an empirical decomposition for two sub-periods (1966-81 and 1981-96) suggests that the rise in profit shares during the second sub-period primarily originated from three sources: a marked fall in real capital prices, a clear upward shift of the return to capital as a result of wage moderation, and a slowdown in the rate of growth of the capital/labour ratio, compared with the first sub-period. </p>
<p> Second, based on various estimates of elasticities of substitution, this slowdown is analysed in greater depth. From the evidence it appears that the adjustment of firms to growing profits and falling user cost of capital compared with wages is, in some sense, sub-optimal. In the short run firms do not substitute capital for labour in full accordance with cost-minimising prescriptions and the speed of convergence towards a complete substitution is slow. Hence, during this transitional period, both investment and labour productivity growth have been relatively low. </p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 April 1999', 'title': 'Higher profits and lower capital prices: is factor allocation optimal?

This paper examines some of the origins of the recent East Asian financial crisis. It is composed of three parts. The first considers the role of moral hazard in the crisis, specifically the influence of implicit and explicit government guarantees which may have contributed to excess borrowing in East Asia, similar to what occurred in Latin America during the 1980s. We then consider the role played by weaknesses in prudential regulation and supervision of both banks and non-bank financial intermediaries. Insufficient official oversight and poor corporate governance arguably were at the root of the limited financial transparency which prevented the correct assessment of risks by market participants. The combination of these two factors can be argued to have shifted credit markets from an equilibrium with excess borrowing to one with excessive credit rationing, resulting in a severe liquidity crisis. Comparisons are made with the micro-financial vulnerabilities which eventually led to earlier financial crises in Latin America and the Nordic countries.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 March 1999', 'title': 'Precarious credit equilibria: reflections on the Asian financial crisis ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work64.htm', 'author': 'Joseph Bisignano', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work64.pdf'}

There are differences in the estimated adjustment functions between the two sectors as well as the durable and nondurable goods firms within each sector. The estimated adjustment function is remarkably stable across subperiods, indicating little change in the inventory adjustment process over time.

This paper examines the terms of bank lending and borrowing by exploring pricing in the federal funds market, the market in which financial institutions trade overnight reserves. By exploiting a never-before-used dataset containing detailed information on every Fedwire transfer between financial institutions, interest rates actually paid by institutions in the funds market are calculated. The size of the trading institutions and their relative importance in the funds market are shown to affect the rates charged for overnight borrowing, thereby providing insight into the nature of competition in the federal funds market. Proxies for creditworthiness are also used to estimate the size and nature of very-short-horizon risk premia. Transaction volume and size-of-transaction effects are also explored, highlighting the role of liquidity in interest rate determination.

Since the trough in 1982, the growth of real foreign direct investment (FDI) outflows and inflows for the OECD countries has been very high, far outpacing that of foreign trade and real GDP. While such flows are likely to have increased the efficiency with which global capital is being used, they have also led to concerns that outflows from the industrial countries serve as an instrument for exporting jobs to low-wage countries. The purpose of this paper is to look for evidence regarding the precise relationship between FDI outflows and employment in the source countries. The empirical evidence mostly relies on estimated relationships between FDI flows and various components of demand but is derived from time-series analyses for individual countries as well as from panel regressions. All in all, we find only limited evidence that FDI outflows lead to job losses in the source countries. While it is true that domestic investment tends to decline in response to FDI outflows, emerging market economies receive only a small, albeit growing, share of global outflows. It also appears that high labour costs encourage outflows and that exchange rate movements may exacerbate such effects. However, the principal determinants of FDI flows are prior trade patterns, IT-related investments and the scope for cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Moreover, there is clear evidence that, by improving distribution and sales channels, FDI outflows complement rather than substitute for exports and thus help protect rather than destroy jobs in the source countries.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 November 1998', 'title': 'Foreign direct investment and employment in the industrial countries', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work61.htm', 'author': 'Palle S Andersen, Philippe Hainaut', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work61.pdf'}

This paper analyses the effect of measurement error in the output gap on efficient monetary policy rules in a simple estimated model of the US economy. While it is a well-known result that such additive uncertainty does not affect the optimal feedback rule in a linear-quadratic framework, it is shown that output gap uncertainty can have a significant effect on the efficient response coefficients in restricted instrument rules such as the popular Taylor rule. Output gap uncertainty reduces the response to the current estimated output gap relative to current inflation and may partly explain why the parameters in estimated Taylor rules are often much lower than suggested by optimal control exercises which assume the state of the economy is known.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 November 1998', 'title': 'Output gap uncertainty: does it matter for the Taylor rule?

This paper brings together two seemingly unrelated branches of the literature that focuses on different aspects of a bank's interaction with its borrowers: the relative priority of bank debt, and the role of banks as "relationship lenders". Specifically, we show that bank seniority plays an important role in encouraging the formation of ongoing bank/firm relationships. Because the bank is senior, it is more able to reap the benefits from its relationship with the firm; because the firm has a relationship with a bank, it is more willing to exert effort, thus reducing the impact of a recession on its prospects. As a result, the firm's ex ante value is enhanced when the bank's debt is senior to that of the firm's other creditors. 
<p align+justify="">The intuition behind our model lies in the fact that, when the firm's prospects deteriorate, the most senior claimant first benefits from helping the firm improve its quality, and it is in such states that the true value of relationship lending comes to light. If banks are made junior to other creditors, they may benefit little in bad states from additional investment in the firm, and hence will have little incentive to build relationships that might allow them to determine the value of such an investment. As a result, making the bank senior improves its incentives to build a relationship with the firm, thereby fulfilling an important function of intermediated debt. </p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 November 1998', 'title': 'The importance of bank seniority for relationship lending ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work58.htm', 'author': 'Stanley Longhofer, João Santos', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work58.pdf'}

This paper examines the one-step prediction of financial time series from a binary decision theory perspective. Under the assumption that the decision statistic of the binary hypothesis testing problem is a Gaussian random variable, bounds for the forecasting efficiency of the hypothesis testing problem are derived. When the criterion for forecasting performance is the total return over the investment period, an optimisation problem is formulated to compute an optimally weighted decision statistic for the binary hypothesis testing problem. Numerical results are illustrated using weekly time series of excess return between two US dollar bond portfolios having six months duration difference. In particular, it is shown that, on average, a 27 basis point excess return per annum is possible against a given benchmark by carrying out active duration management.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 July 1998', 'title': 'One-step prediction of financial time series ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work57.htm', 'author': 'Srichander Ramaswamy', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work57.pdf'}

The empirical results allow the rejection of the expectations theory of the term structure at high levels of statistical significance in every country except Japan. Furthermore, in every country where the expectations theory fails, the failure of the theory is consistent with the spread overreaction hypothesis of Froot (1989) and Campbell and Shiller (1991).

It then goes on to identify a number of important forces for change. Some of these are global in nature, but likely to have a particularly strong impact in continental Europe, while others (such as the introduction of the euro) are distinctively European. The paper then notes just how little restructuring has actually taken place in continental European banking in the last decade and offers some explanations. The conclusion reached is that the banking sector in continental Europe may now be about to enter a period of sharply increased competition.

The paper studies the role of real exchange rates and exchange rate policies in explaining differences in the economic performance in the CFA franc countries, with their fixed exchange rate regime, and another group of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with more flexible arrangements. Policy-makers in inflation-prone countries are faced with a permanent dilemma: should policy priority be given to containing inflation or to maintaining competitiveness through currency depreciation. This policy conflict tends to be aggravated by the fact that in both country groups devaluations seem to have a positive impact on economic activity, throwing doubt on previous work on possible contractionary effects of devaluations. Even so, the question as to whether the pegging of an exchange rate is advantageous, when taking account of both output and inflation effects, remains open, as it partly depends on the supply shocks to which the countries are exposed.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 March 1998', 'title': 'Exchange rate regimes and inflation and output in Sub-Saharan countries ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work53.htm', 'author': 'Marc Klau', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work53.pdf'}

<p>Iceland was a high inflation country from the second half of the seventies and until the middle of the eighties. During the middle of the nineties inflation in Iceland, at less than 2% p.a., was among the lowest in the OECD. In this paper we analyse the roots of high inflation in Iceland and the subsequent disinflation episode. We find that high inflation in Iceland was caused by an increased frequency of external shocks, a tight labour market and a stronger devaluation bias. We further find that disinflation took place in two stages. The first was initiated in 1983 by a policy package of statutory incomes policy and a firmer commitment to exchange rate stability as a response to an inflation crisis. It reduced inflation from the high to the moderate range at negligible cost in terms of output and employment. The second stage took place during the early nineties and reduced inflation from the moderate range to below 3% p.a.. It involved more fundamental changes in policy priorities and public attitudes than the first stage and is more unique in the international context. It was also more costly in terms of output and employment than the first stage, although the costs seem to have been rather small compared to some other countries. A relatively high degree of real wage flexibility, the use of incomes policy, widespread financial indexation and, above all, a broadly based consensus that the general public was best served by low inflation all contributed to this outcome.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '04 January 1998', 'title': 'Inflation and disinflation in Iceland', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work52.htm', 'author': 'Palle S Andersen, Már Guðmundsson', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work52.pdf'}

As central banks have moved towards a forward-looking implementation of monetary policy, the role of forecasts in the policy process has greatly increased. Against this background, this paper looks at the accuracy of forecasts and, more specifically, addresses the question whether forecasts of growth and inflation can be improved by including information from financial markets. The empirical work presented suggests that average forecast errors are not large enough to seriously undermine the basis for forward-looking monetary policies, except in periods of common shocks and at cyclical turning points. It also appears that unexpected changes in non-financial variables are the primary source of forecast errors. Nonetheless, for several countries, forecasts could also be improved by using the information contents of changes in the yield curve and of movements in exchange rates and other asset prices.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 November 1997', 'title': 'Forecast errors and financial developments', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work51.htm', 'author': 'Palle S Andersen', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work51.pdf'}

How will the arrival of the euro affect the dollar? This paper uses portfolio theory to analyse the likelihood and impact of shifts between the dollar and the euro by private asset managers, official reserve managers and global liability managers. It examines the effects on both the level of the dollar and its volatility in three periods: the period before the euro's introduction; the interval until the European Central Bank consolidates its credibility; and the approach to the steady state. While the heavy weight of the Deutsche mark in international holdings of European assets today may suggest a risk intolerance that could lead to shifts into the dollar in the near future, that weight may evidence nothing more than the mark's transactions role. After its introduction, the euro may benefit from shifts by central banks into Treasury bills issued by European governments. In the approach to the steady state, the greater depth, breadth and liquidity of the euro financial markets will attract international investment. But these features should be expected to attract increased international borrowing as well, so there is little reason to expect the dollar to fall against the euro as a result of a net portfolio shifts. There is some reason to expect that in the long run the euro will impart greater volatility to the dollar's exchange rate against all US trading partners.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 November 1997', 'title': 'The euro and the dollar', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work50.htm', 'author': 'Robert N McCauley', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work50.pdf'}

This paper investigates why the slope of the yield curve predicts future economic activity in Germany and the United States. A structural VAR is used to identify aggregate supply, aggregate demand, monetary policy and inflation scare shocks and to analyse their effects on the real, nominal and term premium components of the term spread and on output. In both countries demand and monetary policy shocks contribute to the covariance between output growth and the lagged term spread, while inflation scares do not. As the latter are more important in the United States, they reduce the predictive content of the term spread in that country. The main reason for the stronger leading indicator property in Germany is, however, the positive contribution of supply shocks, which owing to a different monetary policy response explain about half of the positive covariance at lag four in Germany and almost nothing in the United States.				</div>, 'publishdata': '04 September 1997', 'title': 'Why does the yield curve predict economic activity?

A considerable amount of theoretical literature suggests that, contrary to the predictions of textbook analysis, exchange rate devaluations may be contractionary rather than expansionary. This hypothesis has also received considerable empirical support. However, prior statistical analyses of the effects of exchange rate devaluation on output have been subject to several limitations: (i) they have failed to distinguish adequately between short and long-run effects; (ii) they have not controlled for the full range of external shocks; and (iii) they have not considered whether the effects of devaluation might differ between different regions of the world. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of devaluation on output for 27 countries while attempting to address these limitations in previous empirical analyses. We find no evidence that devaluations are contractionary in the long run. Additionally, controlling for sources of spurious correlation and reverse causality appears to mute the measured contractionary effect of devaluation in the short run, although evidence that this effect exists remains even after these controls are introduced. Finally, no significant differences among the regions stand out; in fact, while the literature on contractionary devaluation has focused primarily on developing countries, we found no evidence that this effect is stronger in developing countries than in industrialised countries.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 September 1997', 'title': 'Some multi-country evidence on the effects of real exchange rates on output', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work48.htm', 'author': 'Steven Kamin, Marc Klau', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work48.pdf'}

The work presented in this paper falls into two parts. First, using a simple model and within the context of the central bank's objective of price stability, it is shown that the optimal monetary response to unexpected changes in asset prices depends on how these changes affect the central bank's inflation forecast, which in turn depends on two factors: the role of the asset price in the transmission mechanism and the typical information content of innovations in the asset price. In this context, the advantages and disadvantages of setting monetary policy in terms of a weighted average of a short-term interest rate and an asset price such as the exchange rate - a Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) - are discussed. The second, more empirical, part of the paper documents, using an estimated policy reaction function, the short-term response to financial asset prices, including the exchange rate, in two countries with inflation targets (Australia and Canada) and suggests that the different response to exchange rate changes in these countries can in part be explained by differences in their underlying sources.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 September 1997', 'title': 'Financial asset prices and monetary policy: theory and evidence', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work47.htm', 'author': 'Frank Smets', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work47.pdf'}

Many global investors are faced with the problem of choosing an appropriate currency allocation of their assets in the capital markets. This paper addresses the asset allocation problem under the assumption that the investment universe is comprised of unhedged risk-free bonds in different countries. In general, the total return arising from holding an unhedged bond portfolio is comprised of two components. One component of the return arises from the bond price changes resulting from yield curve movements and the other component arises from exchange rate fluctuations. In this paper, bond price changes are assumed to be governed by a one factor interest rate term structure model. The return arising from exchange rate changes is extracted by modelling the evolution of exchange rates as a jump stochastic process. The jump process is assumed to occur in the volatility of exchange rate returns. This model is consistent with the empirical evidence that the volatility of currency returns exhibits GARCH behaviour. Using the models that describe the evolution of interest rates and exchange rates, the optimal portfolio allocation problem is solved in a mean-variance setting by Monte Carlo simulation. The out-of-sample performance of the portfolios selected is also presented and is compared against those obtained using other existing methods.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 September 1997', 'title': 'Global asset allocation in fixed income markets', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work46.htm', 'author': 'Srichander Ramaswamy', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work46.pdf'}

This paper describes research comparing the response of inflation to changes in exchange rate competitiveness in various regions of the world. The paper first presents evidence that an empirical relationship between the <i>rate</i> of inflation and the <i>level</i> of the real exchange rate, which was documented for Mexico in previous research by the author, holds for a large set of other countries as well. This result may pose a dilemma for policy-makers, since it implies that it may not be possible to achieve low inflation and a high export competitiveness simultaneously. The paper then demonstrates that the responsiveness of inflation to the real exchange rate has been much higher in Latin America than in Asian or industrialised countries. This difference in inflationary responsiveness is not fully explained either by the prior history of inflation or by the extent of openness to foreign trade. It is possible that the lower responsiveness of inflation to the real exchange rate in Asia than in Latin America is what has allowed the Asian countries to remain more consistently focused on maintaining competitiveness and export growth.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 August 1997', 'title': 'A multi-country comparison of the linkages between inflation and exchange rate competitiveness', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work45.htm', 'author': 'Steven Kamin', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work45.pdf'}

This paper examines the issues of excess volatility and excess comovement of interest rates among global bond markets. The base model of interest rate behaviour is the expectations theory of the term structure. The empirical evidence presented in the paper indicates that ten-year government bond yields in five major markets - the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada - have in the past displayed both excess volatility and excess comovement relative to the base model. This suggests that term premia at the long end of the term structure are both time-varying and positively correlated across markets.				</div>, 'publishdata': '03 July 1997', 'title': 'Is there excess comovement of bond yields between countries?', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work44.htm', 'author': 'Gregory Sutton', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work44.pdf'}

This paper uses weekly data on short-term eurorates for ten countries for the period 1979-96 to document that the ability of the expectations hypothesis (EH) to account for movements in the term structure is greater, and that short- term interest rates are more predictable, under fixed than under floating exchange rates. The paper also shows that the higher predictability does not arise solely because of monetary policy responses to speculative pressures in the foreign exchange markets: while it is more difficult to reject the EH in periods of exchange market turmoil, the EH is not rejected in tranquil periods.				</div>, 'publishdata': '02 July 1997', 'title': 'Exchange rate regimes and the expectations hypothesis of the term structure', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work43.htm', 'author': 'Stefan Gerlach, Frank Smets', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work43.pdf'}

In the identified VAR literature the role of the exchange rate in measuring monetary policy shocks has often been neglected. However, many open economies find it useful to target the exchange rate. In such a regime exchange rate innovations will better capture domestic monetary policy shocks.

Next, these weights are used to identify a typical monetary policy shock in these countries and analyse its effects on output, inflation, the interest rate and the exchange rate.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 June 1997', 'title': 'Measuring monetary policy shocks in France, Germany and Italy: The role of the exchange rate', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work42.htm', 'author': 'Frank Smets', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work42.pdf'}

This study argues that the introduction of the euro would have a more immediate and direct impact on European bond markets than on European banking markets. The single currency would create a single private yield curve in the near term and could also lead to a more integrated government bond market. While the immediate impact of the euro for banking markets would be limited, the switch over time by European corporations from bank debt to bond debt would come on top of the competitive challenge that European banks already face. The need for banks to adjust raises a number of potential issues for public policy in Europe, some of which may have broader international implications.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 May 1997', 'title': 'The Euro and European financial markets', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work41.htm', 'author': 'Robert N McCauley, William R White', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work41.pdf'}

<p>In recent years monetary policy operating procedures have continued to evolve in the light of changes in the structure and workings of financial markets as well as in the broader economic and political environment. Since the mid-1980s, central banks have further strengthened the market-orientation of policy implementation, cut reserve requirements, widened the range of available instruments, increased the flexibility of liquidity management, sharpened the focus on interest rates as operating targets, improved the transparency of policy signals and shortened the maturity of interest rates serving as the fulcrum of policy. While these trends have resulted to some extent in a continuation of the process of convergence dating back to at least the 1970s, significant differences still exist across countries. This paper reviews current monetary policy implementation procedures within a common framework in order to highlight similarities and remaining differences across countries.

Understanding what caused the recent costly wave of banking system failures in developing and transition economies is the key to preventing a recurrence. It is important to distinguish between epidemics of the macroeconomic and micro-economic varieties, and between these and the syndrome of endemic failure, associated with pervasive government involvement. Each type has its characteristic warning signs - the availability of the relevant indicators is discussed in some detail - and a comprehensive prevention policy must take account of each. 
<p>Thus, for example, it is unwise to defer macroeconomic stabilisation in the hope of concealing banking sector weakness. Likewise, a rigorous application to developing and transition economies of the consensus approach to microeconomic regulation should not be deferred. Political interference is the Achilles heel of any regulatory system: among other mechanisms, it may be possible to use disclosure rules and the pressures of globalisation to increase the political attraction of regulatory enforcement. </p> </div>, 'publishdata': '04 January 1997', 'title': 'Banking system failures in developing and transition countries: Diagnosis and predictions', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work39.htm', 'author': 'Patrick Honohan', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work39.pdf'}

The deregulation of domestic financial markets, in association with technological progress, has led to an explosion of cross-border financial transactions and the cross-border establishment of premises. In turn, this has led to a need for international agreements on how the business of international finance and banking should be conducted. Private and public sector bodies have generally both been actively involved, but leadership has varied depending on the purpose of the agreement in question. Agreements to facilitate the conduct of cross-border financial transactions have in large measure been driven by private sector agents. Conversely, agreements to deliberately encourage the expansion of cross-border competition and to promote and maintain financial stability have been led by the public sector given the possibility of significant economic externalities. Many agreements to promote financial stability have been reached by committees operating at the Bank for International Settlements under the aegis of the Governors of the Group of Ten. Such agreements have moral authority, being based on discussions among representatives of sovereign states, but are nevertheless enforceable only by domestic legislation or regulation.				</div>, 'publishdata': '01 October 1996', 'title': 'International agreements in the area of banking and finance: accomplishments and outstanding issues ', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work38.htm', 'author': 'William R White', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work38.pdf'}

Following Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) and Estrella and Mishkin (1995a, b), we study the ability of the term structure to predict recessions in eight countries. The results are fourfold. First, the yield curve provides information about the likelihood of future recessions in all countries. Second, term spreads are useful for predicting recessions as much as two years ahead. Third, while German and US spreads are frequently significant in the regressions for the other countries, the added information is limited except in Japan and the United Kingdom. Fourth, while leading indicators contain information beyond that in term spreads, this information is only useful for forecasting recessions in the immediate future.

This paper reviews some of the issues confronting central banks in their choice of monetary operating instruments and techniques. As a result of efforts by governments to improve efficiency in financial systems, together with developments in financial information, computation and communication technology, central banks are having to increasingly rely on flexible operating instruments and techniques which convey in a convincing manner to market participants their near-term objectives. This has contributed to the relative decline in the importance of standing credit facilities and the greater reliance on flexible open market intervention techniques.

Although the EH is rejected in several countries, in all countries actual and theoretical long interest rates do move closely over time.

<p>This paper examines the sharp rise in bond yield volatility across the major bond markets in 1994. The analysis covers thirteen industrialised countries and is largely based on OTC data for implied bond yield volatility. We conclude that the market's own dynamics seem to provide a stronger explanation than variations in market participants' apprehensions about economic fundamentals. We identify three market dynamics: downward markets increase volatility; volatility spills over from certain markets onto others; and it can rise in the wake of substantial withdrawals of foreign investments. We find more limited evidence that monetary or fiscal policies accounted for the rise in volatility, at least by our measures. Moreover, changing expectations about growth and inflation, while perhaps at work in particular countries, do not offer much of a general explanation.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '22 December 1995', 'title': 'The anatomy of the bond market turbulence of 1994', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work32.htm', 'author': 'Robert N McCauley, Claudio Borio', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work32.pdf'}

The most likely reason for the rejection of the theory when these data points are excluded is simultaneity bias, the importance of which is mitigated when high-inflation countries are included in the sample.

<p>This paper discusses the main potential sources of instability of money demand in Europe originating from institutional changes in the financial system and currency substitution. Money demand equations might appear unstable if the dynamic specifications are too rigid. This can largely be overcome by using error-correction models. Once this model is applied, money demand in the countries reviewed is reasonably stable and economically well behaved. Estimations show that currency substitution is an important feature of financial behaviour in Europe. It supports the proposition that an EC-wide money stock would possess stability properties superior to individual countries' money demand. </p> </div>, 'publishdata': '21 November 1995', 'title': 'Money demand stability and currency substitution in six European countries (1980-1992)', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work30.htm', 'author': 'Renato Filosa', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work30.pdf'}

In this paper we compare the effects of monetary policy on output and prices in the G-7 countries using a parsimonious macroeconometric model comprising, output, prices and a short-term interest rate. We identify monetary policy shocks by assuming that they do not affect real output instantaneously (within the quarter) or in the long run and implement these restrictions using a sequential instrumental variables technique. We show that the so-called pricepuzzle which has been noticed in the large VAR-literature in which only shortrun restrictions are used, disappears. This suggests that the puzzle is due to the fact that the use of only short-run identifying restrictions does not properly discriminate between contractionary aggregate supply shocks and monetary policy shocks.

Two key conclusions are highlighted. First, as segmentation has weakened, the compartmentalisation of prudential regulation and supervision has come under pressure. At the same time, how far harmonisation in prudential arrangements can, or indeed, should, be extended remains a moot question.

A negative effect is identified in Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the Untied States, and a positive one in the remaining countries.

Cointegration analysis and error-correction modelling in fact show that the demand for it is stable and predictable, with a statistical performance which compares most favourably with national equations. And Granger-causality tests, conducted in both bivariate and multivariate settings for a wide range of specifications, indicate that it has predictive value for both nominal and real Community income. Aggregates including CBHs perform differently according to the definition. "Very broad" measures (which include EC-residents' CBHs kept outside the EC or non-ECresidents' CBHs kept within the EC but denominated in non-EC currencies) are poorly linked with EC-wide income, since they do not pass cointegration tests and do not Granger-cause Community income. In contrast, extended definitions "focused on the EC" (which hinge on the inclusion of CBHs denominated in EC-currencies andlor kept within the EC) are shown to possess the economic properties necessary for money measures to be useful for monetary policy and economic analysis. Although such extended aggregates do not yet outperform the traditional measure of EC-wide broad money, the results suggest that they may shortly become an increasingly important tool for monetary analysis at the EC level. </span></p> </div>, 'publishdata': '19 October 1993', 'title': "'All the money in europe?'

<p class="Paragraph"><span lang="EN-GB">Co-integration analysis and error-correction modelling show that a stable and predictable aggregate demand for broad money holds for the group of countries participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System. This result seems robust to different econometric techniques, samples and methods of conversion of national variables into ecus. Furthermore, ERM-wide equations compare favourably with national equations and with the previous estimates of area-wide equations for narrow money. These findings suggest that an area-wide broad monetary aggregate can play a useful role in the co-ordination of monetary policy at the European level. </span></p> </div>, 'publishdata': '18 April 1992', 'title': 'European integration and the demand for broad money', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work18.htm', 'author': 'Carlo Monticelli, Marc-Olivier Strauss-Kahn', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work18.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>This paper discusses developments in energy consumption and oil markets since the early 1970s, highlighting the fall in energy and oil consumption per unit of output and the accompanying reduction in industrialised countries' exposure and vulnerability to energy shocks. In an attempt to analyse the determinants of aggregate output, a very simple model is subsequently presented to discuss the major transmission channels of energy price shocks and the related risk of disturbances to long-term equilibrium growth. The focus is then turned on investment and the capital stock and their role in the determination of energy demand. Energy demand equations are empirically derived for seven major countries, distinguishing in each case between demand for energy in industry, transportation and the commercial and residential sectors.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '17 July 1991', 'title': 'Energy shocks and the demand for energy', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work17.htm', 'author': 'Palle S Andersen, Henri J Bernard', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work17.pdf'}

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This paper explores primarily how financial arrangements may be responsible for creating or exacerbating inflationary pressures in Yugoslavia. The ways in which financial arrangements can contribute to inflation are discussed under three different headings: misallocation of savings and credit, failure to enforce financial discipline and accommodation by the monetary authorities. Ultimately, however, these are to a significant extent manifestations of the same phenomenon. They describe a situation where resources can be obtained without adequate screening and monitoring, where their apparent cost does not reflect their scarcity value, where agents are capable of shifting the costs of economic failure on to the "government", where, therefore, there do not exist proper mechanisms for discriminating between productive and unproductive economic behaviour. Under these conditions, not only can inflation be generated or perpetuated, but traditional measures of government transfers and related monetary financing lose much of their significance.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 November 1990', 'title': "Financial arrangements, 'soft' budget constraints and inflation: lessons from the Yugoslav experience", 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work15.htm', 'author': 'Claudio Borio', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work15.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>This paper calculates the effect of European financial integration on the long-run sustainable budgetary situations of individual countries and highlights the adjustments required in order to conform with "integrated" and "domestic" steady-state scenarios. In the relative tightening/loosening of the steady-state budget constraint in comparing scenarios, the change in the real rates of interest is shown to play a central role, while the effect of the change in the reserve system variables is a minor one and that of the change in the rates of inflation is only significant in the highest inflation countries. Different factors are at play in the relative tightening/loosening of the steady-state budge constraint in small northern and southern countries. The tightening/loosening of the steady-state budget constraint between the "domestic" and "integrated" scenarios has implications for the comparative conduct of fiscal policy, in particular, taxation.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '02 September 1990', 'title': 'The steady-state budget constraint and the integration of european financial markets: an arithmetical exercise', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work14.htm', 'author': 'José Ramalho', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work14.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>A natural resource based export boom can increase overall national wealth and improve a country's balance of payments position, but leave some sectors in a protracted and costly adjustment process. This phenomenon is known as "Dutch disease", a term associated with the difficulties experienced by the Dutch manufacturing sector after the natural gas boom, hike in world energy prices and expansion of the gas-revenue financed government sector expansion in the Netherlands. This paper reviews the theoretical predictions of a country experiencing a resource boom. It then briefly describes the country experiences of the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom in this regard and finally develops a methodology for a more formal statistical analysis designed to shed light on the relationships between the energy sector and manufacturers in these countries, as well as to identify other potential explanatory factors.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 September 1990', 'title': 'Manufacturing sector resiliency to energy booms: Empirical evidence from Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work13.htm', 'author': 'Michael M Hutchison', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work13.pdf'}

<p>The main purpose of this paper is to test the hypothesis that, especially in Europe, excessive real wage growth and falling profit shares have been instrumental in reducing investment growth and the employment potential of the capital stock.

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>This paper examines some salient features of the balances of payments of the developed countries outside the Group of Ten since 1968, first comparing their current accounts to those of the other main groups in the world, then relating their export performance to that of the OECD area as a whole and finally examining the financing of their current-account deficit and the resulting indebtedness. Despite the diversity of the countries in the ODC group, they have not generally suffered pronounced, prolonged external disequilibria as a result of autonomous disturbances, thanks to tight monetary policy and structural reforms. The policy reaction of ODCs to the two oil shocks has differed with regards to the financing of the consequent deficits (from reserves in the case of the first shock; by external borrowing in the case of the second), resulting high levels of indebtedness for some ODCs.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '03 November 1984', 'title': 'The external balance of the smaller industrial countries: international developments and national policies since 1968', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work11.htm', 'author': 'Jonathan Hoffman', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work11.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>This paper summarises the main features of an expectations-augmented Phillips curve with accompanying mark-up price equations. The empirical counterparts for six countries are presented. Even though preliminary, the results are relatively satisfactory in terms of statistical fit and a priori expectations with respect to the sign and size of the parameters. However, in periods when both inflation and unemployment have increased far above historical trends, it is somewhat unsatisfactory to assume that the level of unemployment is exogenous and independent of the inflation process. Moreover, considering the simultaneous changes in relative prices and real wages, there would seem to be some merit in incorporating these variables – directly and indirectly – in the wage formation process.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 July 1984', 'title': 'Real wages, inflation and unemployment', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work9.htm', 'author': 'Palle S Andersen', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work9.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>This paper focuses on the yen's role as a currency of invoice and financial asset. Further aspects of the internationalisation of the yen (e.g. non-resident borrowing in yen) are not dealt with directly. The relatively small importance of the yen in trade invoicing suggests that the "transaction balance" portion of yen holdings has been small. This argument is further reinforced by the fact that the growth of non-resident holdings of yen assets has been closely related to the development of the exchange rate, coupled with the low level of yen sight accounts with Japanese banks. This implies that the advantage that the Japanese economy would enjoy from internationalisation is small, since the major advantage to the home country of an international currency is that it can fund part of its imports with non- or low-interest bearing liabilities. Furthermore, the exchange rate has been made more vulnerable to external shocks, although direct disturbance on of the domestic financial market has so far not been too serious.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 July 1982', 'title': 'A survey of the international use of yen', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work6.htm', 'author': 'Hiroo Taguchi', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work6.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>This paper divides money created by banking systems into two separate components, corresponding to a classification of the services provided by banking systems. The model of division into the amounts of intermediation and pure liquidity creation has some implications that are different from those of other models of the demand for money. In particular, the paper finds no evidence of a strong or stable relationship between the demand for bank money and income, and between the demand for money and interest rates. Further, it is suggested that owned deposits arising from intermediation have greater inflationary or anti-inflationary potential than borrowed deposits arising from pure liquidity creation.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 February 1981', 'title': 'Intermediation and pure liquidity creation in banking systems', 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work5.htm', 'author': 'William A Allen', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work5.pdf'}

<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>The purpose of this paper is analyse the factors that influence conditions in the Euro-currency market, focusing separately on demand and supply factors. The paper tentatively concludes that the main reasons for the present borrowers' market seem to be, first, the turn-round in the US current account, from a large surplus in 1974-76 to an equally large deficit in 1977-78 and, second, a much narrower (or even reversed) interest rate spread in the US financial market. The increased aggressiveness of the banks in their external lending activity seems to have amplified the squeezes on margins, but the effects of the outside factors seem more important than this "endogenous" factor.</p> </div>, 'publishdata': '01 April 1980', 'title': "Determinants of Market Condtions in the Euro-Currency Market - Why a 'Borrowers' Market'", 'url': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work1.htm', 'author': 'Kengo Inoue', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.bis.org/publ/work1.pdf'}
