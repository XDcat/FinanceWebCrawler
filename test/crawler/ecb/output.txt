We discuss the properties of such indicator and stress that it is related to a notion of risk that does not coincide with that of Gaussian risk underlying most mainstream models. We postulate that it is associated with a broader definition of risk, which we call hazard in order to avoid confusion. The properties of the Global Hazard Indicator (GHI) are assessed against the background of the market turbulence in 1998. This period has been characterized by abnormal fluctuations in the exchange rate markets spurred by a sequence of shocks in some emerging economies and in South East Asia, which have raised fear of contagion in developed countries.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>F01</strong> : International Economics→General→Global Outlook<br/><strong>F31</strong> : International Economics→International Finance→Foreign Exchange<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '1 May 1999', 'title': 'A global hazard index for the world foreign exchange markets', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-1999.include.en.html', 'author': 'Vincent BrousseauFabio Scacciavillani', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp001.pdf?14e04cc5febe813648551a4836f7ead1'}

Using a sample covering the last twenty years, a cointegrating vector linking the real stock of loans to a small set of domestic macroeconomic variables is found. Besides real GDP and prices, this set includes a new measure of the cost of loans obtained as a weighted average of bank lending rates. The results are overall encouraging, though the recursive estimates of the long-run parameters suggest that in 2000 some disturbances, probably of a temporary nature, affected the system. The study then addresses the issue of the leading indicator properties of loans.

For the importing country, PTM effects can be interpreted as a measure of the stability of domestic prices against foreign price and exchange rate developments. PTM behaviour can be attributed to the level of competitiveness and price stickiness in the importing country.
This paper investigates PTM behaviour in the euro area  from the importing country's perspective, for both individual countries and the euro area as a whole. Analysis firstly involves the estimation of PTM effects in the five largest euro area countries. Secondly, PTM effects in the euro area as a whole are estimated to be slightly higher than one half. The results from illustrative simulations suggest that the increase in euro-area inflation during the first two years of monetary union can be largely attributed to oil price and exchange rate developments.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>C32</strong> : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models, Multiple Variables→Time-Series Models, Dynamic Quantile Regressions, Dynamic Treatment Effect Models, Diffusion Processes<br/><strong>E31</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles→Price Level, Inflation, Deflation<br/><strong>F14</strong> : International Economics→Trade→Empirical Studies of Trade<br/><strong>F47</strong> : International Economics→Macroeconomic Aspects of International Trade and Finance→Forecasting and Simulation: Models and Applications<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '9 January 2004', 'title': 'Import prices and pricing-to-market effects in the euro area', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2004.include.en.html', 'author': 'Thomas Warmedinger', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp299.pdf?43adad35ac76bd935391a30b69bcfda7'}

Furthermore I consider the role of real wage rigidities. Optimal policy features significant deviations from price stability in response to various shocks. This is so since search externalities generate an unemployment/inflation trade-off. In response to productivity shocks optimal policy is pro-cyclical when the worker’s bargaining power is higher than the share of unemployed people in the matching technology and viceversa. This is so since when the workers’ share of surplus is high there are many searching workers and few vacancies hence the monetary authority has an incentive to increase vacancy profitability by reducing the interest rate and increasing inflation. The opposite is true when the workers’ share of surplus is high. This implies that optimal inflation volatility is U-shaped with respect to workers’ bargaining power.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>E52</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit→Monetary Policy<br/><strong>E24</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Consumption, Saving, Production, Investment, Labor Markets, and Informal Economy→Employment, Unemployment, Wages, Intergenerational Income Distribution, Aggregate Human Capital<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '12 January 2007', 'title': 'Ramsey monetary policy with labour market frictions', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2007.include.en.html', 'author': 'Ester Faia', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp707.pdf?a9a339750c60cde794628d4b110d1d86'}

The short run dynamics is governed by a VAR model including six shocks. The state-space framework is convenient for the decomposition of endogenous variables in trends and cycles, for shock decomposition, for incorporating external judgement, and for running conditional projections. The forecast performance of the model is rather satisfactory. The model is used to carry out a policy experiment with the objective of investigating whether euro area countries differ in the labour market adjustment to a reduction in labour costs.

To do so, it exploits a unique transaction-level dataset on French firms containing information on cross-border monthly transactions matched with data on worldwide intrafirm linkages as defined by property rights (multinational business groups, hierarchies of firms). This newly assembled dataset allows us to distinguish firm-level transactions among two alternative organizational modes of global value chains: internalization of activities (intragroup trade/trade among related parties) or establishment of supply contracts (arm's length trade/trade among unrelated parties). After an overall assessment of the role of global value chains during the trade collapse, we document that intra-group trade in intermediates was characterized by a faster drop followed by a faster recovery than arm's length trade. Amplified fluctuations in terms of trade elasticities by value chains have been referred to as the "bullwhip effect" and have been attributed to the adjustment of inventories within supply chains. In this paper we first confirm the existence of such an effect due to trade in intermediates, and we underline the role that different organizational modes can play in driving this adjustment.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>F23</strong> : International Economics→International Factor Movements and International Business→Multinational Firms, International Business<br/><strong>F15</strong> : International Economics→Trade→Economic Integration<br/><strong>L22</strong> : Industrial Organization→Firm Objectives, Organization, and Behavior→Firm Organization and Market Structure<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '4 January 2012', 'title': 'Global value chains during the great trade collapse: a bullwhip effect?', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2012.include.en.html', 'author': 'Filippo di MauroGianmarco I.P.

Relative to the existing literature, our model enables us make a judgment on the relative importance of the channels of international technology transmission. We find that direct technology transfer is positive while there are negative R&amp;D spillovers. However, since R&amp;D is found to positively affect TFP in own sector, the model implies that after accounting for both R&amp;D and TFP spillovers, there is a total positive impact of R&amp;D on TFP in the same sector while the overall impact of R&amp;D on TFP in other sectors and countries is negative.

Using quarterly data from the Investment Property Databank (IPD), the analysis covers a total of 10,000 listed properties over the period 2001-2011. The study contributes to the empirical literature by introducing a spatial econometric methodology into a hedonic framework, via a spatially lagged explanatory variable (spatially lagged valuations per square metre). The results provide significant evidence of the presence of spatial dependence in unit valuations in all sub-sectors of the commercial property market, namely retail, office, industrial and residential. Accordingly, high (low) priced commercial properties tend to be geographically clustered rather than randomly distributed over space. The comparison of the alternative transaction-based indices shows a systematic upward bias in the baseline transaction-based indicator that relies solely on prior appraisals. In addition, compared to the baseline indicator, the spatially augmented transaction-based price indicator appears to fluctuate less and is more robust to small sample sizes.

First, cash is preferred to other payment instruments whenever consumers have enough balances at hand. Second, it is optimal for consumers to hold a stock of cash for precautionary reasons. Exploiting survey payment diaries from Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands, the results of the simulations show that both optimal policies are well suited to understand the high shares of low-value cash payments in Canada, France and Germany. Yet, they do not perform as well in the case of the Netherlands, overestimating the share of low-value cash payments. We discuss how the differences in payment markets across countries may explain the limitations of the two optimal policies.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>C61</strong> : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Mathematical Methods, Programming Models, Mathematical and Simulation Modeling→Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis<br/><strong>E41</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Money and Interest Rates→Demand for Money<br/><strong>E47</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Money and Interest Rates→Forecasting and Simulation: Models and Applications<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '13 January 2016', 'title': 'Cash management and payment choices: a simulation model with international comparisons', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2016.include.en.html', 'author': 'Carlos ArangoDavid BounieYassine BouhdaouiMartina EschelbachLola Hernandez-van Gijsel', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1874.en.pdf?1e60e03037c7148c7e412adb6af4cec4'}

This paper investigates whether there is evidence for dynamic – instead of the currently used static – elasticities in euro area countries. Applying country-specific error correction models we reveal important differences across countries. For a majority of euro area Member States we find evidence for dynamic revenue elasticities. We show that the application of such dynamic elasticities could substantially reduce forecast errors in several countries – with the evidence being stronger based on ex-post than based on real-time data.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>E62</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Macroeconomic Policy, Macroeconomic Aspects of Public Finance, and General Outlook→Fiscal Policy<br/><strong>H68</strong> : Public Economics→National Budget, Deficit, and Debt→Forecasts of Budgets, Deficits, and Debt<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '20 January 2017', 'title': 'Revenue elasticities in euro area countries', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2017.include.en.html', 'author': 'Gerrit KoesterChristoph Priesmeier', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1989.en.pdf?aa52786a7c7aabc8bcc69943aa8a3afc'}

The potential amplification role of asset managers is taken into account in a stylised fashion.

{'body': <div class="content-box"><dl><dt>Abstract</dt><dd>We examine the implications of less powerful forward guidance for optimal policy using a sticky-price model with an effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates as well as a discounted Euler equation and Phillips curve. When the private-sector agents discount future economic conditions more in making their decisions today, an announced cut in future interest rates becomes less effective in stimulating current economic activity. While the implication of such discounting for optimal policy depends on its degree, we ﬁnd that, under a wide range of plausible degrees of discounting, it is optimal for the central bank to compensate for the reduced effect of a future rate cut by keeping the policy rate at the ELB for longer.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>E52</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit→Monetary Policy<br/><strong>E58</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit→Central Banks and Their Policies<br/><strong>E61</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Macroeconomic Policy, Macroeconomic Aspects of Public Finance, and General Outlook→Policy Objectives, Policy Designs and Consistency, Policy Coordination<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '11 January 2019', 'title': 'Attenuating the forward guidance puzzle: implications for optimal monetary policy', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2019.include.en.html', 'author': 'Taisuke NakataRyota OgakiSebastian SchmidtPaul Yoo', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2220.en.pdf?d1db5aaa7c11758b71779f58a4895866'}

{'body': <div class="content-box"><dl><dt>Abstract</dt><dd>We analyse the effects of supranational versus national banking supervision on credit supply, and its interactions with monetary policy. For identification, we exploit: (i) a new, proprietary dataset based on 15 European credit registers; (ii) the institutional change leading to the centralisation of European banking supervision; (iii) high-frequency monetary policy surprises; (iv) differences across euro area countries, also vis-à-vis non-euro area countries. We show that supranational supervision reduces credit supply to firms with very high ex-ante and ex-post credit risk, while stimulating credit supply to firms without loan delinquencies. Moreover, the increased risk-sensitivity of credit supply driven by centralised supervision is stronger for banks operating in stressed countries. Exploiting heterogeneity across banks, we find that the mechanism driving the results is higher quantity and quality of human resources available to the supranational supervisor rather than changes in incentives due to the reallocation of supervisory responsibility to the new institution. Finally, there are crucial complementarities between supervision and monetary policy: centralised supervision offsets excessive bank risk-taking induced by a more accommodative monetary policy stance, but does not offset more productive risk-taking. Overall, we show that using multiple credit registers – first time in the literature – is crucial for external validity.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>E51</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit→Money Supply, Credit, Money Multipliers<br/><strong>E52</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit→Monetary Policy<br/><strong>E58</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit→Central Banks and Their Policies<br/><strong>G01</strong> : Financial Economics→General→Financial Crises<br/><strong>G21</strong> : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Banks, Depository Institutions, Micro Finance Institutions, Mortgages<br/><strong>G28</strong> : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Government Policy and Regulation<br/></dd><dt>Network</dt><dd>Research Task Force (RTF)</dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '2 January 2020', 'title': 'Banking supervision, monetary policy and risk-taking: big data evidence from 15 credit registers', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2020.include.en.html', 'author': 'Carlo AltavillaMiguel BoucinhaJosé-Luis PeydróFrank Smets', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2349~515abecc84.en.pdf?bc7b45f1c15e0eed7624d3528586abef'}

We argue that regression tree models are ideally suited for macroeconomic nowcasting in the face of extreme observations, for instance those produced by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. This is due to their flexibility and ability to model outliers. In an application involving four major euro area countries, we find substantial improvements in nowcasting performance relative to a linear mixed frequency VAR.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>C11</strong> : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Econometric and Statistical Methods and Methodology: General→Bayesian Analysis: General<br/><strong>C32</strong> : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models, Multiple Variables→Time-Series Models, Dynamic Quantile Regressions, Dynamic Treatment Effect Models, Diffusion Processes<br/><strong>C53</strong> : Mathematical and Quantitative Methods→Econometric Modeling→Forecasting and Prediction Methods, Simulation Methods<br/><strong>E37</strong> : Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics→Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles→Forecasting and Simulation: Models and Applications<br/></dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '11 January 2021', 'title': 'Nowcasting in a pandemic using non-parametric mixed frequency VARs', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2021.include.en.html', 'author': 'Florian HuberGary KoopLuca OnoranteMichael PfarrhoferJosef Schreiner', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2510~310814c1ed.en.pdf?5a0b7212ce3c76e65e07f3246bd43401'}

{'body': <div class="content-box"><dl><dt>Abstract</dt><dd>Does the level of deposits matter for bank fragility and efficiency? In a banking model with endogenous bank runs and a consumption-saving decision, we show that the level of deposits has opposite effects on bank fragility depending on the nature of bank runs. In an economy with panic-driven runs, higher deposits make banks less fragile, while the opposite is true when runs are only driven by fundamentals. The effect of deposits is not internalized by depositors. A saving externality arises, leading to excessive fragility and insufficient liquidity provision. The economy features under-saving when runs are panic driven, and over-saving when fundamental driven.</dd><dt>JEL Code</dt><dd><strong>G01</strong> : Financial Economics→General→Financial Crises<br/><strong>G21</strong> : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Banks, Depository Institutions, Micro Finance Institutions, Mortgages<br/><strong>G28</strong> : Financial Economics→Financial Institutions and Services→Government Policy and Regulation<br/></dd><dt>Network</dt><dd>Research Task Force (RTF)</dd></dl></div>, 'publishdata': '11 January 2022', 'title': 'Savings, efficiency and the nature of bank runs', 'url': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/papers-2022.include.en.html', 'author': 'Agnese LeonelloCaterina MendicinoEttore PanettiDavide Porcellacchia', 'keyword': None, 'attachment': 'https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2636~919f4a1ecd.en.pdf?155062fb5379f0920a72a7410b949100'}
